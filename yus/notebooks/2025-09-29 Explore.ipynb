       " 'detailedDescription': 'The proposed research aims to establish the efficacy of an imagined gait protocol for improving gait and cognition in the elderly. This imagined gait protocol involves imagined gait in single (imagined walking; iW) and dual-task (imagined walking while talking; iWWT) situations. A single-blind randomized clinical trial of 58 cognitively-healthy elderly with pre-post measures of gait, cognition, and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during imagined gait is proposed. The overall hypothesis is that imagined gait can be used as a rehabilitative tool for improving gait and cognition in the elderly because it engages and strengthens similar neural systems as actual gait and cognition. The first aim of this study is to establish the efficacy of our imagined gait protocol to improve gait and cognition in the elderly. We predict that our imagined gait intervention will improve gait velocity during actual walking and walking-while-talking conditions to a greater extent than the active control (visual imagery) intervention. We also predict that our imagined gait intervention will cognitive performance during dual-task walking conditions. The second aim of this study is to determine neuroplasticity changes in response to our imagined gait protocol. We predict that the neural systems engaged during imagined gait will change following our imagined gait intervention.'}"

Using the SPM12 package, data were normalized per standard, open source routines. Using a General Linear Model framework, a model was estimated with regressors (after convolution with hemodynamic response function) for 2-back \\& 1-back conditions for each subject to predict BOLD change each day (arm).For analysis of group effects, second-level, between-subject analyses on normalized images of the 2-back minus 1-back beta estimate from the first level were entered into regression models, with mean frame displacement as a co-variate of no-interest to test contrasts between the arms/interventions. Using a FPN mask, the eigenvalues from the second-level estimates were extracted and entered into the analysis as an outcome measure. Note: eigenvalues are arbitrary units. Larger values indicate more BOLD signal.\n",

Connectivity (correlations of BOLD signal) was first calculated for each participant, and then spatially averaged in MNI brain space, between participants. A 'cluster' of connectivity was identified, only if the number of voxels (thresholded at P \\<0.001) exceeded the count of 25. The outcome measure here is a count of the number of clusters exceeding this threshold, across all subjects. It represents significant connectivity between the site of stimulation and that cluster in the brain, for all subjects.\n",

       " 'detailedDescription': 'Depression, like many psychiatric disorders, has a genetic component that makes it more likely that members of the same family will have the disorder. Depression in parents, particularly mothers, may put the children at greater risk for depression. When an adolescent whose parent is depressed develops depression himself or herself, treating both the parent and the adolescent may be more effective than treating only the adolescent. This study will test a depression treatment that targets depressed suicidal adolescents with a parent or primary caretaker who is also depressed and has a history of suicidality.\\n\\nParticipation in this study will last 6 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either concurrent parent and adolescent treatment or adolescent only treatment. For those assigned to concurrent treatment, both the adolescent participants and one of their parents will receive individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) counseling sessions and joint family counseling sessions. In the adolescent only treatment condition, adolescent participants will receive individual CBT sessions, but parents will not, and both will receive joint family sessions. Counseling sessions will last 1 hour and occur weekly for 3 months, and then every other week for 3 months. CBT identifies and attempts to change problematic thought patterns. All participants will receive medication consultation if necessary.\\n\\nParticipants will complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. These assessments will include questionnaires and interviews about depression, suicidal thoughts, mood regulation, behavioral problems, and family. At post-treatment and the 6-month follow-up, participants will also be asked to give feedback about the counseling, medication consultation, and their satisfaction.'}"

At each training session the facilitator will describe one strategy, provide examples, and practice the strategy through role play.

Session 1 was devoted to rapport building, understanding the relevant social and medical situation, presenting an overview of the PST curriculum, and assigning the first homework - identifying a solvable problem. Session 2 reviewed prior homework, introduced the idea of developing alternative solutions, and assigned homework - defining and evaluating options. Session 3 reviewed homework, developed an action plan and assigned homework - implementing the action plan. Sessions 4-6 depended on the outcome of the actions, focusing on alternative plans if the results of the action plan were not satisfactory to the client or on additional problems if the results were satisfactory.\n",

The home visitors implemented a structured set of educational interventions, with written materials in English or Spanish, on the following topics: what is asthma, asthma medications and devices, asthma action plan, how to recognize and respond to symptom onset, and how to reduce irritants and allergens in the home. Home visitors referred families, when necessary, to existing health insurance enrollment assistance, smoking cessation, and other community support services. Home visitors communicated with the primary care provider via FAX, giving summaries of interventions, updates on progress, and noting family difficulties and needs (for example, needing equipment, prescriptions, or an (updated) asthma treatment plan).\n",
