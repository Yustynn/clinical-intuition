The investigators hypothesize that at posttest, controlling for pretest data and compared to the usual care group, the PAINRelieveIt group will: a) report decreased scores for worst pain intensity and pain misconceptions; b) have increased analgesic adherence (primary outcome); and c) have a larger proportion who report satisfaction with pain intensity and whose nurses obtained appropriate analgesics for the patients' pain.\",\n",
       "   'detailedDescription': \"Unrelieved cancer pain at the end of life is a major health problem and is inconsistent with patient-centered goals for their last days. Building on a successful approach researched in outpatient oncology settings, the investigators propose a study testing PAINRelieveIt, a system-level intervention of computerized tools with patient-reported pain outcomes (in English, Spanish, Chinese languages), decision support for clinicians (English) and multimedia education tailored to each cancer patient and lay caregiver.\\n\\nUsing a 1-week pre-test/post-test randomized design in patients receiving home level hospice care provided by two Chicago-area hospices, we will compare effects of usual hospice care with PAINReportIt Summary and usual hospice care with PAINRelieveIt on pain outcomes. The tablet-based PAINRelieveIt includes valid and reliable pain tools (PAINReportIt), a summary of the patient's pain data with decision support for hospice nurses to obtain recommendations for algorithm-based analgesic therapies (PAINConsultN), and multimedia education tailored to the patient's and lay caregiver's pain management misconceptions (PainUCope). Patient's/caregiver's answers are automatically stored in an electronic database, from which the system generates a PAINReportIt Summary (usual hospice care control group); PAINConsultN and PainUCope (experimental group). All patients will receive usual hospice care. All patients/caregivers will complete PAINReportIt at pretest and 1-week later (posttest); patients also complete parts of PAINReportIt daily. Via daily e-mail updates, the control-group hospice nurses will receive a PAINReportIt Summary and experimental-group hospice nurses will receive a PAINConsultN. Additionally, experimental group patients/caregivers will view multimedia educational materials via PAINUCope to help patients report pain and adhere to prescribed analgesics.\\n\\nSpecific aims are to compare usual hospice care and PAINRelieveIt groups for effects on:\\n\\n1. Patient outcomes (analgesic adherence; worst pain intensity, satisfaction, and misconceptions) and lay caregiver outcome (pain misconceptions) in a diverse sample of 250 cancer patient-caregiver dyads receiving hospice care.\\n2. Nurse outcomes (obtained appropriate analgesics for patient) in a sample of hospice nurses.\\n\\nThe investigators hypothesize that at posttest, controlling for pretest data and compared to the usual care group, the PAINRelieveIt group will: a) report decreased scores for worst pain intensity and pain misconceptions; b) have increased analgesic adherence (primary outcome); and c) have a larger proportion who report satisfaction with pain intensity and whose nurses obtained appropriate analgesics for the patients' pain.\\n\\nFindings will guide future system-level research to implement PAINRelieveIt in a multi-site, longitudinal trial that will test the effect of disseminating this technology on clinical decisions for managing pain and patient/caregiver pain outcomes in a national sample of hospices. This approach offers improved pain control for dying patients and other populations.\"},\n",

These data are consistent with the high percentage (98%) of patients who reported a desire for no pain but whose worst pain was greater than the level they desired.

Validity of the BQ is supported by its ability to discriminate cancer patients who report high BQ scores and also were under-medicated for their pain level and were hesitant to report their pain to their clinicians. To improve the acceptability of the tool to patients with cancer, we reduced the tool to 13 items with demonstrated validity and reliability.

Using the SPM12 package, data were normalized per standard, open source routines. Using a General Linear Model framework, a model was estimated with regressors (after convolution with hemodynamic response function) for 2-back \\& 1-back conditions for each subject to predict BOLD change each day (arm).For analysis of group effects, second-level, between-subject analyses on normalized images of the 2-back minus 1-back beta estimate from the first level were entered into regression models, with mean frame displacement as a co-variate of no-interest to test contrasts between the arms/interventions. Using a FPN mask, the eigenvalues from the second-level estimates were extracted and entered into the analysis as an outcome measure. Note: eigenvalues are arbitrary units. Larger values indicate more BOLD signal.\n",

Connectivity (correlations of BOLD signal) was first calculated for each participant, and then spatially averaged in MNI brain space, between participants. A 'cluster' of connectivity was identified, only if the number of voxels (thresholded at P \\<0.001) exceeded the count of 25. The outcome measure here is a count of the number of clusters exceeding this threshold, across all subjects. It represents significant connectivity between the site of stimulation and that cluster in the brain, for all subjects.\n",

Depression in parents, particularly mothers, may put the children at greater risk for depression. When an adolescent whose parent is depressed develops depression himself or herself, treating both the parent and the adolescent may be more effective than treating only the adolescent. This study will test a depression treatment that targets depressed suicidal adolescents with a parent or primary caretaker who is also depressed and has a history of suicidality.\\n\\nParticipation in this study will last 6 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either concurrent parent and adolescent treatment or adolescent only treatment. For those assigned to concurrent treatment, both the adolescent participants and one of their parents will receive individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) counseling sessions and joint family counseling sessions. In the adolescent only treatment condition, adolescent participants will receive individual CBT sessions, but parents will not, and both will receive joint family sessions. Counseling sessions will last 1 hour and occur weekly for 3 months, and then every other week for 3 months. CBT identifies and attempts to change problematic thought patterns. All participants will receive medication consultation if necessary.\\n\\nParticipants will complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. These assessments will include questionnaires and interviews about depression, suicidal thoughts, mood regulation, behavioral problems, and family. At post-treatment and the 6-month follow-up, participants will also be asked to give feedback about the counseling, medication consultation, and their satisfaction.'}"
