            "brief_description": "To evaluate the effectiveness of two different diabetes self-management approaches (Personal Digital Assistant-based intervention \\& Chronic Disease Self-Management Program) to reduce health disparities in minority, rural residents, and other underserved populations with type 2 diabetes in Central Texas. We hypothesise that: 1) Racial\/ethnic minority patients with T2DM will be found to experience disparities in diabetes self-management treatment protocols and clinical outcomes, which persist even when controlling for age, gender, obesity, and insurance status; 2) Patients with T2DM who reside in more rural areas will be found to experience disparities in diabetes self-management treatment protocols and clinical outcomes as compared to more urban counterparts, controlling for age, gender, race\/ethnicity, obesity, and insurance status; 3) The introduction of CSDMP and HIT protocols will improve diabetes-related self management behaviors, reduce HBA1c values, and increase quality of life in persons with T2DM as compared to controls. A combined intervention approach will result in the greatest reductions; 4) Health improvements following the introduction of CDSMP, HIT or CDSMP\/HIT protocols in persons with T2DM compared to controls will be more marked in racial\/ethnic minority patients and those patients residing in rural areas; 5) The introduction of self-management interventions will be cost-effective in reducing HbA1c values over time, and associated health care utilization including overall reduction in ER and acute care hospital admissions; 6) Although there is little prior research in this area to guide specific hypotheses, we hypothesize that, overall, there will be no significant cost-effective differential in CDSMP as compared to HIT approaches, although the cost-effective ratio may be stronger in particular subpopulations. The combined approach will have higher costs, but is also anticipated to have a higher cost-benefit ratio for minority populations; 7) The majority of clinicians will be willing to let their patients enroll in the study and will reinforce intervention protocols; and 8) These interventions can be embedded into existing health care structures. At the end of the study, Scott and White will institutionalize cost-effective treatment protocols."

            "brief_description": "Veterans have a high risk of developing lung in comparison to general populations due to their older age and smoking history. Recent evidence indicates that lung cancer screening with low dose CT scan reduces lung cancer mortality among older heavy smokers. However, the rates of false positive findings are high, requiring further testing and evaluation. The aims of this study were to 1) elicit patient and provider stakeholder input to inform the development of a lung cancer screening decision tool, 2) develop a web-based Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool (LCSDecTool) that incorporates patient and provider input, and 3) conduct a RCT to evaluate LCSDecTool compared to usual care knowledge about LCS, decisional conflict and uptake of LCS.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that the use of the LCSDecTool would decrease decisional conflict at 1 month. As a secondary outcome the investigators hypothesized that there would be a decrease in uptake of LCS in the LCDDecTool group compared with the control intervention due to increased awareness of harms associated with LCS. Additional secondary outcomes were LCS knowledge, decisional regret, anxiety, and lung cancer worry.\n\nVeterans who were receiving primary care in a participating VA Medical Center, aged 55 to 80 years with a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years who were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years were eligible to participate in the study.\n\nParticipants were asked to link on to a study website and were randomly assigned to the LCSDecTool or a control intervention website. Following use of the intervention, participants had a primary care visit. Patient reported outcomes were assessed immediately post intervention and at 1 and 3-months post intervention. LCS uptake was assessed at 6 months post-intervention."

The investigators will adapt PainTracker, a web-based outcome and treatment tracking tool already deployed in multiple University of Washington clinics to create the PTSM self-management tool that helps assess, engage, activate, and support patients' efforts to self-manage their chronic pain in collaboration with their clinicians. PTSM design will be based on 4-phase patient engagement strategy derived from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Phase 1 focuses on achieving consensus on the clinical problem definition, treatment goals and timeline. Phase 2 focuses on promoting values-based action and acceptance of pain. Phase 3 focuses on providing skills in chronic pain self-management with close monitoring of patient reported outcomes and actigraphy. Phase 4 focuses on providing autonomy support to promote maintenance of self-management behaviors. Phase 5 involves generating a patient registry with the above data for use in quality improvement research. The investigators will engage patients, providers and investigators in designing PTSM, reviewing prototypes, and conducting usability testing. In a 6-month clinical trial, the investigators will compare 50 intervention patients from the UW Center for Pain Relief who receive PTSM to 50 historical control patients who have received the basic PainTracker. The primary outcome will be chronic pain self-efficacy, with secondary outcomes of: chronic pain acceptance, perceived efficacy in physician-patient interactions, and patient and provider satisfaction. Development of the PTSM platform will support the dissemination of the multimodal interdisciplinary care for chronic pain that is recommended in the National Pain Strategy, and may help chronic pain care meet the goals of the Triple Aim: better patient experience, better patient outcomes, with lower costs."

With the rise in standardized testing of school-age children and the concurrent attempts to improve their scores, finding simple and inexpensive methods to bolster performance is needed.\n\nObjective: To examine the effects of gum chewing on standardized test scores and class grades in a group of 8th grade math students.\n\nDesign: Math classes were randomized to a gum chewing (GC) condition that provided students with gum during class and testing, or a control condition with no gum (NG) provided during class and testing. This study was conducted during the Spring 2008 school semester.\n\nSetting: A charter school in Houston, TX.\n\nParticipants: All students enrolled in eighth grade math at the charter school were approached for recruitment in this study. A total of 108 (94%) students participated. Participants were between the ages of 13 and 16.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: The Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS), the Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Achievement (WJ-III), and math class grades were used to assess any differences in academic performance between the GC and NGC conditions. For purposes of this study, only the math sections of the WJ-III and TAKS, which are both standardized tests, were assessed.\n\nOur primary hypothesis was that adolescents in a gum chewing (GC) condition would have significantly improved standardized test scores and math grades compared to adolescents in a non-gum chewing (NG) control condition."

Other psycho-educational alcohol-related content is also provided in the intervention including strategies for decreasing exposure to cues that increase drinking desires and how to cope with increased desire to drink. This brief intervention is used in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing young adults who receive the brief, online intervention to those who did not receive the brief, online intervention.

There is an urgent need to develop strategies to prevent or slow down memory loss and brain function decline in the elderly.\n\nIn this study, the investigators hope to learn how physical exercise and a brain training program work together to improve thinking and memory in older adults. Specifically, these aims include:\n\n* Learning whether physical activities (like biking or treadmill walking or Wii Fit games) will help improve the benefits of a brain training program. Based on preliminary results and that in the literature, the investigators anticipate greater cognitive benefits in the Exercise + Cognitive training groups than the Cognitive Training alone group.\n* To determine whether the benefits of adding exercise will occur quickly or develop more gradually over time. The investigators suspect that a major benefit of exercise pre-dosing will occur by the 12th week of the program.\n* To examine whether Wii-Fit exercise games cause similar effects on brain training as traditional exercise programs such as biking or walking. Although several recent studies have raised questions about the true aerobic benefit of exergames such as Wii-Fit Plus, other evidence suggests that these weaker aerobic benefits may be offset by the greater novelty and interest level afforded by exergames."

The two intervention groups will receive detailed instructions e.g. for proper coughing and sneezing, and for regular cleaning of hands with either standard liquid soap or with alcohol-based gel rubbing. Third group will serve as the control and is advised not to change their previous behaviour in this respect. The participants will report weekly possible RTI or GTI symptoms and related days off through internet.

            "brief_description": "The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a mobile, semi-automated text message-based intervention (MILK) to prevent perceived low or insufficient milk supply (PIM) among mothers without prior breastfeeding experience. PIM is the leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation, and prior work shows that it is often rooted in low breastfeeding self-efficacy and misconceptions about lactation physiology and trajectory. The MILK intervention is designed to address PIM, as well as other common breastfeeding problems via semi-automated text messages of prenatal and postpartum breastfeeding education and support. Messages are time-sensitive (e.g., specific to gestational age, time since delivery) and based on the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy (Social Cognitive) Theory; they are also modeled from pilot work that investigated how first-time mothers view, manage and describe breastfeeding problems. Messages were vetted with clinical lactation experts, as well as pregnant and postpartum women with no other children.\n\nThe MILK intervention will be trialed against a control intervention group, who will receive general perinatal education through the national Text4Baby system. The investigators will recruit approximately 186 healthy, pregnant women at 13-25 weeks gestation from Magee Women's Hospital clinics and outpatient sites. Women will be randomized via computer-generated simple randomization to the experimental or control intervention. Both groups will receive text messages 3-5 times per week from week 25 of pregnancy through week 8 postpartum. Measured outcomes of interest will include perceived breast milk supply, breastfeeding confidence, maternal anxiety, breastfeeding exclusivity, and breastfeeding duration. Data will be collected at baseline (13-25 gestational weeks), 34-36 gestational weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum via online survey or telephone call. To assess the potential longer-term impact of the intervention, breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity will be reassessed via telephone at 6 months postpartum. Between group and group x time differences in outcome measures will be examined graphically and via linear mixed modeling. To inform modifications to MILK, telephone interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants in each group to assess and compare intervention use, burdens and challenges, and suggested alterations (8 weeks)."

            "title": "Integrated Treatment for Adolescents With ADHD",
            "brief_description": "Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exists in 20-50% of the 3 million adolescents annually enrolled in outpatient mental health and substance use treatment. Adolescents with ADHD present deficits in attention, self-regulation, and social competence that significantly impede achievement of developmental and educational milestones. Currently there are only two evidence-based treatment options for this age group: academic training and stimulant medications. Both options remain vastly underutilized. Academic training is not available in most school settings and rarely implemented in clinical care. Similarly, ADHD medications are rarely utilized with adolescents in primary or specialty care for a host of reasons related to stigma, misinformation about effects and side effects, and adolescent autonomy issues. Moreover, the widespread fragmentation of pharmacological versus behavioral services prevents families from making informed treatment selections.\n\nThe primary objective of this randomized parametric trial is to compare the effectiveness of behavioral only versus integrated (behavioral plus medication decision-making) interventions for adolescents with ADHD in outpatient behavioral services. The behavioral intervention, Changing Academic Support in the Home for Adolescents with ADHD (CASH-AA), contains three components: ADHD psychoeducation, family-based motivational interventions, and academic training. The medication decision-making intervention, Medication Integration Protocol (MIP), contain three components: psychoeducation about ADHD medication, family decision-making, and medication management. The study will compare the effects of two legitimate treatment options for adolescents with ADHD on service utilization, behavioral symptoms, and quality of life. It will generate new evidence on patient-centered treatment selection that aligns with family-specific principles and treatment goals.\n\nThis parametric comparative trial will randomly assign 140 inner-city adolescents with ADHD to (1) CASH-AA Only or (2) CASH-AA + MIP. Treatment will occur in community behavioral health clinics. All participants will receive behavioral interventions (CASH-AA): family psychoeducation in ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, and developmental impacts; family-based motivation and ADHD accommodation interventions; and academic training focused on home environment support and organizational skills. Half of the participants will also receive medication decision-making interventions (MIP): ADHD medication psychoeducation, family decision-making interventions, and (for those who elect to start medication) coordinated medication management. Half of the sample will have comorbid substance use problems. Treatment will occur in three community clinics; therapists will be randomly assigned to study condition. Caregivers and adolescents will complete assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up. Multilevel modeling will compare the effectiveness of each condition on key patient and service use outcomes. Patient-centered analyses will explore differential treatment effects based on (a) Medication decision (yes\/no); (b) Substance use comorbidity (yes\/no); (c) Race\/Ethnicity (Hispanic, African American).\n\nQuantitative outcome analyses will test for service use effects, symptom reduction, and quality of life improvements that are primary reasons for seeking clinical services. Qualitative interviews will document family-specific rationale for decisions about medication, compliance with behavioral and medication interventions, and suggestions for improving services and service integration. Note that families assigned to CASH-AA Only will retain the option of pursuing ADHD medication through treatment-as-usual procedures at their respective clinic. Similarly, families assigned to CASH-AA + MIP will not be required to start ADHD medication. Instead, they will receive informed-choice interventions and can choose when and if to start medication; the study will assess the impact of these decisions on clinical outcomes.\n\nIf proven efficacious, the CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be rapidly disseminated individually or as an integrated protocol into routine behavioral healthcare settings. The protocols can also be readily combined with other behavioral treatments to form a multicomponent treatment package for adolescents with co-occurring behavior problems. In addition, the family-based, patient-centered CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be delivered in conjunction with other family-based treatments or with individual approaches that flexibly include caregivers in multiple treatment sessions. This makes CASH-AA and MIP highly efficient clinical resources for addressing ADHD-related problems in any outpatient setting that serves adolescents and their families."

Two different self-regulation interventions for weight gain prevention will be compared in this trial; one intervention will focus on making small, consistent, changes in eating and exercise behavior to prevent weight gain or reverse weight gain if it occurs, whereas the other will emphasize larger changes in eating and exercise that occur periodically, with a goal of producing weight loss and thereby providing a buffer against anticipated weight gains. The primary aim of the trial is to test whether the magnitude of weight gain from baseline across an average three-year follow-up differs across the three groups, with the hypotheses that weight gain will be greater in the Control group than in either intervention and greater in the Small Changes than Large Changes group.\n\nSNAP-E (Extension) will determine whether the effects of the intervention can be maintained over an additional 3 years (i.e. through a total of 6 years)."

            "brief_description": "Serious mental illness (SMI) is the second most costly disorder treated in the VHA, yet clinical outcomes for these patients in public sector settings are often poor due to a combination of low quality care and severe cognitive and functional impairments evidenced by this group. While these problems are multifaceted, studies outside the VHA have shown that using \"consumer providers\" (CPs) can improve and augment public care. Similar to recovering addiction counselors, CPs are individuals with SMI who use their lived experiences to provide services to others with SMI. CPs can reach out to patients that are difficult to engage, assist patients with tasks of daily living, offer a variety of rehabilitation (vocational, social, residential) services, be role models and offer hope for recovery, and facilitate support groups. Randomized controlled and quasi-experimental trials, all done outside the VHA, have shown that CPs can provide services that yield at least equivalent patient outcomes with particular benefits noted on intensive case management teams. Based on these successes both the President's New Freedom Commission and the Veteran Administration's Mental Health Strategic Plan call for broader dissemination of CPs as way to make mental health services more recovery-oriented, a recent national priority. Because of these recent calls, employing mentally ill veterans has just begun, although no effort has been made to evaluate their impact inside the VA mental health system. Yet its success outside the VHA and the recent emphasis on recovery-oriented care suggests the need to test this model in the VHA."

Additionally, current pediatric obesity care delivery relies on an outdated provider:patient paradigm which is ill-suited for a problem as prevalent as obesity. HCSs often lack the organizational structure to provide longitudinal care for children with chronic illnesses, the clinicians to manage and support patients with chronic illnesses outside of clinic, and\/or the health information systems that support the use of evidence-based practices at the point-of-care. Thus, the research question this study is designed to address is whether a novel approach to care delivery that leverages delivery system and community resources and addresses socio-contextual factors will improve family-centered childhood obesity outcomes.\n\nThe primary specific aims are to examine the extent to which the intervention, compared to the control condition, results in:\n\n1. A smaller age-associated increase in BMI over a 12-month period.\n2. Improved parental and child ratings of pediatric health-related quality of life.\n\nThe secondary aims are:\n\n1. To examine parental ratings of quality and family-centeredness of pediatric obesity care and compare outcomes among participants in the intervention with the control condition\n2. To assess change in weight-related behaviors and compare outcomes among participants in the intervention with the control condition\n3. To assess the following process measures:\n\n   * Reach\n   * Extent of implementation\n   * Fidelity to protocol\n   * Parent satisfaction\n4.

            "brief_description": "Male-to-female intimate partner violence accounts for 26% of violence-related injuries in women presenting in hospital emergency departments and 33% of all female homicides. Adolescence provides an excellent \"window of opportunity\" for the prevention of intimate partner violence. Patterns of relating in intimate relationships are still relatively undifferentiated and open to influence. However, the evidence supporting traditional, school-based programs for the prevention of teen dating violence is mixed. A major problem with existing programs is that they are \"one size fits all,\" making it difficult to meet the diverse needs of students-boys and girls, individuals who are dating and those who are not, individuals who have experienced dating violence as a victim, perpetrator, or both, and those who have not. Perhaps most importantly, these interventions neglect individual differences in readiness to use healthy, non-violent ways of relating to stay violence-free. In Phase I the objective was to use expert system technology to integrate best practices for teen dating violence prevention with the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM), the \"stage model,\" to develop an interactive, multimedia computer-administered change program that delivers individualized intervention sessions and exercises tailored to stage of change and other individual characteristics. In Phase II, the objective was to complete development of the intervention package and assess its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial involving 3,901 teens from 20 Rhode Island high schools randomly assigned to intervention or comparison. Among youth exposed to risk for dating violence, efficacy was assessed by comparing the intervention and comparison groups on dating violence perpetration and victimization at follow-up. Among youth not exposed to risk for dating violence, efficacy was assessed by comparing intervention and comparison on peer violence perpetration and victimization."

In Phase 1, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, wear an accelerometer around the waist for 7 days, and undergo an exercise stress test. The accelerometer and exercise stress test will be used to determine whether participants are eligible to be randomized for the intervention study. In Phase 2, participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) receiving a physical activity tracker (a Fitbit) or 2) receiving a Fitbit AND engaging in videoconferencing sessions with a physical activity coach. During Phase 2, participants will also be asked to complete 3 assessments (weeks 9 and 22, and a 6-month follow-up). The week 9 assessment will consist of completing questionnaires and wearing an accelerometer for 7 days. Week 22 will be similar to week 9 with the addition of a final exercise stress test. The 6-month follow-up will mirror the week 9 assessment.\n\nParticipants who are randomized to the videoconferencing condition will be asked to meet with a physical activity coach 8 times over the course of 20 weeks. Coaches will help participants to (1) change attitudes toward physical activity, (2) increase perception of others' approval of physical activity (e.g., family members, peers), and (3) increase participants' perceived control by troubleshooting barriers and increasing efficacy for physical activity. Coaches will use the Fitbit to facilitate self-monitoring and goal setting. Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to participate in a focus group at the conclusion of the study to share their experiences."

            "brief_description": "Pedestrian injuries are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in American children ages 7-8, but existing behavior-oriented interventions achieve only modest success. One limitation to existing interventions is that they fail to provide children with the repeated practice needed to develop the complex perceptual and cognitive skills required for safe pedestrian activity.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) offers a highly promising technique to train children in pedestrian safety skills. VR permits repeated unsupervised practice without risk of injury; automated feedback to children on success or failure in crossings; adjustment of traffic density and speed to match children's skill level; and an appealing and fun environment for training. The proposed research is designed to test the efficacy of virtual reality as a tool to train child pedestrians in safe street-crossing behavior.\n\nA randomized controlled trial will be conducted with four equal-sized groups of children ages 7-8 (total N = 240). One group will receive training in an interactive and immersive virtual pedestrian environment. The virtual environment, already developed, has been demonstrated to have face, construct, and convergent validity. The second group will receive pedestrian safety training via video and computer strategies that are most widely used in American schools today. The third group will receive what is judged to be the most efficacious treatment currently available, individualized behavioral training at streetside locations. The fourth and final group will serve as a no-contact control group. All participants in all groups will be exposed to a range of field- and laboratory-based measures of pedestrian skill during baseline and post-intervention visits, as well as during a six-month follow-up assessment. Primary analyses will be conducted through linear mixed models designed to test change over time in the four intervention groups. We hypothesize all children in active learning groups will increase pedestrian safety skills, but the largest increase will be among children in the virtual reality group."

Investigating the effect of promising therapies, such as protective step training, will enhance our ability to treat Veterans with MS who are at risk for falls.

            "brief_description": "The investigators have developed a three component intervention to support shared decision-making during the early recovery phase for older adults who present to the emergency department (ED) or orthopedic urgent care with acute musculoskeletal pain. The first component is a brief interactive video to enhance patient knowledge and self-efficacy regarding treatment options with the intent of facilitating conversations between patients and emergency providers. The second component is a protocol-guided phone conversation (telecare) between a nurse care manager and the patient at 48-72 hours following discharge to assess pain severity and interference with daily activities, review analgesic use and side effects and recovery-promoting behaviors, and discuss adjustments to the patients treatment. The third component is communication with the patient's primary care provider following the telecare call to inform them of the patient's condition and treatment plan and encourage primary care followup. The short-term objective of this project is to test the efficacy of this intervention to reduce the transition from acute to chronic musculoskeletal pain among older adults and obtain data to inform implementation. The investigators will conduct a three-arm randomized controlled trial with adults aged 50 years and older who present to the ED or orthopedic urgent care with acute musculoskeletal pain. Patients will be randomized to (1) the full intervention (video + telecare + communication with primary provider), (2) video alone, or (3) usual care. The primary outcome will be pain, measured longitudinally over the course of the year following the acute care visit. Secondary outcomes will include physical function, analgesic side effects and adverse events, opioid use, depression and anxiety symptoms, sleep duration and quality, and healthcare utilization at one, three, six, and twelve months. Secondary analyses will (1) examine whether the intervention has its effect by promoting shared decision-making, and (2) estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The long-term goal of this work is to develop, test, and implement interventions that improve long-term health outcomes for older adults with acute musculoskeletal pain."

We will collect baseline ethnographic and survey data from approximately 27 IDU or MSM sites in India. We will use baseline data to select 22 sites for the trial (12 IDU and 10 MSM) and to stratify sites according to key baseline characteristics. We will perform stratified randomization to assign sites to either the ICC intervention or to standard services. ICCs, which will be either IDU or MSM-focused, will provide an accepting atmosphere in which members of vulnerable groups can drop-in, receive rapid HIV voluntary counselling and testing, risk reduction counseling and services, and antiretroviral therapy. ICCs will be scaled-up from existing governmental or non-governmental organizations and services provided at ICCs will be supported by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of India. After providing services in communities for two years, we will conduct an evaluation survey (with biological and behavioral measures) of approximately 1000 subjects in the target populations in each of the 22 study sites. Integrated care centers have the potential to improve access to HIV prevention and treatment services among vulnerable, high-risk populations."

            "brief_description": "Veterans with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder experience high levels of disability and poor community outcome, and these poor functional outcomes constitute a major public health concern. The treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. Needed improvements in community outcome for patients with these disorders will not occur simply through better control of clinical symptoms. Instead, it is necessary to find new treatments that address the key determinants of poor functional outcome, including social cognition. Both basic (non-social) cognition and social cognition are considered key determinants of functional outcome for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Basic cognition includes the domains of: learning and memory, vigilance \/ attention, speed of processing, reasoning and problem solving, and working memory. Social cognition generally refers to mental operations that underlie social interactions, including perceiving, interpreting, managing, and generating responses to socially relevant stimuli, including the intentions and behaviors of others. As part of the investigators' previous Merit grant, they have developed a training program for social cognition and are in the process of validating it. Initial results suggest that the program improves performance on measures of social cognition and functional capacity.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will evaluate whether adding an in vivo component (training activities that occur in the community) to the current social cognition intervention facilitates generalization of training effects to community outcome and subjective satisfaction. Outcome measures of social cognition and functional capacity will be examined during the 12 week training program, and durability of benefits will be assessed at a 3-month follow up. Generalization to community functioning and subjective satisfaction will be assessed at the end of training and at the 3-month follow up. The investigators will enroll 105 patients across the 5 years of the study with random assignment to training group (social cognition intervention with in vivo exercises, social cognition intervention without in vivo exercises and control). Subjects will receive assessments at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-point), completion of training (12 weeks), and the 3-month follow up."

            "brief_description": "BACKGROUND: Annually \\>400,000 US newborns require neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care.1\/3 will require ongoing or specialty care after discharge. Some NICU graduates can be classified as children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who will require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. NICU parents report increased anxiety and stress during their stay and transition home from the NICU. Short-term peer-to -peer programs during hospitalization decrease stress, anxiety and depression for mothers, however, no studies have evaluated the effects of long term post-discharge peer support. Children's National (CN) provides medical home services to CSHCN through its Parent Navigator Program (PNP). Parent Navigators (PNs) are CSHCN parents who provide peer emotional support, access to community resources, and assistance with navigating complicated health systems. NICU graduates and their caregivers may benefit from support provided by PNs after discharge. No data regarding the impact of PNs on patient and family outcomes of the NICU graduate are available.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a PNP on a parent's self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, depression\u037e infant health care utilization, and immunization status.\n\nMETHODS: 300 NICU graduates will be randomized to receive either PN for 12 months (intervention group) or usual care (comparison group). Baseline data at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge will be collected from caregivers in both groups including scales for self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, and depression, infant healthcare utilization and immunization status. Outcomes will be compared at 12 months.\n\nPATIENT OUTCOMES (PROJECTED) The study outcomes are parental self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, and depression\u037e infant health care utilization and immunization status.\n\nANTICIPATED IMPACT Prior studies utilizing small samples have suggested that peer support in the NICU can reduce anxiety and depression in caregivers. It is unclear whether peer support after discharge, when a family is faced with the total care of their child without structured supports, can significantly impact parents' ability to care for their child. The investigators anticipate that this simple intervention will increase self-efficacy in caregivers, reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, in turn resulting in improved health outcomes for their child."

Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body makes insulin but does not use it properly. It is often referred to as \"pre-diabetes\". Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both sugar and insulin in their blood at the same time, which have been reported in patients with endometrial cancer.\n\nIn this study, metformin will be compared to a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.\n\nLifestyle intervention is made up of a series of in-person sessions where you meet with a coach to discuss strategies for losing weight and ways to increase physical activity.

Participants will attend two laboratory sessions. At one session participants will take part in a brief laboratory stress task and at the other participants will rest for the same period. Measures of cardiovascular response will be assessed at both sessions. In addition, blood will be drawn at multiple time points across a 125 minute period to assess changes in circulating levels of cortisol, catecholamines, markers of inflammation and cell free mitochondrial DNA in response to the task. The investigators expect that the stress task will induce a specific increase in ccf-mtDNA, which will statistically mediate subsequent peak circulating Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 levels. In secondary analyses, the investigators will examine whether stress-induced increases in circulating cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels correlate with increases in ccf-mtDNA. These studies will establish the kinetics and magnitude of psychological stress-induced ccf-mtDNA release, the association with early stress mediators, and whether ccf-mtDNA mediates the inflammatory response to acute stress in humans."

The investigators' study evaluated the effects on care processes and outcomes of a multi-institutional quality improvement initiative focused on preventing hospital associate infections. The investigators' hypothesis was that the strategies for implementing safe critical care practice will differ in level of achievement whereby the Collaborative group will perform better than the Tool Kit group. The outcome measure comprised clinical event rates and an index of safe practices that represent a bundling of key process measures related to evidence-based practices for preventing catheter-related blood-stream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia in the intensive care unit."

            "brief_description": "People with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder experience high rates of physical illness and die earlier than people without serious mental illness (WHO, 2005). Health differences seem to be worse among African Americans (Weber, Cowan, Millikan \\& Niebuhr, 2009). High rates of obesity among this group contribute to health and wellness concerns (de Hert et al., 2011), with African American women at higher risk of obesity than men. Behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLIs) may promote diet and physical activity that lead to weight loss, but healthy food and safe physical activity options are less available in low-income neighborhoods. Peer navigators have been found to be effective in addressing health differences, and may help people living in low-income communities find healthy food and activity resources (Fischer, Sauaia, \\& Kutner, 2007). In addition, traumatic experiences are common among persons with serious mental illness as well as African Americans, and may impact weight.\n\nThrough this project, investigators will test two interventions designed to address overweight and obesity among African Americans with serious mental illness. The first is a BWLI designed for persons with serious mental illness and adapted to meet the needs of African Americans. This program has 8-month intervention phase and 4-month maintenance phase. The intervention includes group weight management classes, group physical activity, individual visits to address barriers to meeting weight goals, and weigh-ins. The second intervention is a peer navigator program that assists people with serious mental illness in meeting their health needs in the community. Two-hundred and seventy (270) research participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: BWLI program, BWLI program plus peer navigator, and treatment as usual (integrated physical and mental health care). Investigators will evaluate these interventions over a 12-month period, and will track weight change, health behaviors, physical and mental health, recovery, and quality of life. Investigators also seek to understand the impact of gender and trauma on outcomes. Investigators hypothesize that peer navigators will improve outcomes over the BWLI program alone. Findings will advance knowledge and services to reduce racial disparities in obesity and comorbid health conditions for African Americans with serious mental illnesses."

Our study is one of the first to examine the implementation of a tailored behavioral\/educational self-management intervention in primary care clinics designed to improve CVD risk. The proposed study could result in a leap forward in CVD risk management among veterans for several reasons: 1) ) This is a novel extension of our previous interventions that have demonstrated improved BP, now designed to address multiple chronic conditions contributing to CVD risk, particularly hyperlipidemia and diabetes. The study focuses on both multiple CVD-related risk factor management and medication management 2) The intervention is multi-behavioral; it addresses patients' various health behavior (e.g., smoking, diet, and medication adherence). 3) Components of the intervention will include specific recommendations and transportability of intervention application software and tracking packages that will allow clinic managers to implement the intervention if it is effective."

Obesity, a growing problem for Americans and Veterans alike, is the greatest risk factor for the development of OSA. Male gender and smoking, other OSA risk factors, are common in Veterans. Given the high comorbidity of these risk factors in Veterans, OSA presents a significant health burden to Veterans. The investigators' prior work provides evidence that OSA occurs in up to 69% of Vietnam-era Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). OSA is easily treated; however, 15-30% of OSA patients are non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the standard OSA treatment. The proposed research aims to facilitate adherence to CPAP treatment by testing a novel cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention in Veterans with PTSD. If successful, it may represent an approach that could be applied to the rehabilitation of other chronic conditions with similar barriers to care."

Oncology clinical trials have traditionally excluded older patients with advanced cancer and chronic health conditions. In this context, where data is limited and risk from treatment is high, older patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers must understand how cancer treatment can affect quality of life in light of underlying health status. Better communication about age-related health conditions between oncologists, older patients with advanced cancer, and their caregivers may improve decision-making for cancer treatment and quality of life. A geriatric assessment (GA), a validated set of patient-centered outcomes, has been shown to identify concerns (e.g., function, cognition) important to older persons with cancer and their caregivers. In this cluster randomized clinical trial we examined whether providing a web-generated GA summary with targeted recommendations to older patients with advanced cancer, their caregivers, and their oncologists can improve communication about age-related concerns that could affect efficacy and tolerance of cancer treatment. We also determined whether the intervention improves patient-reported quality of life and patient and caregiver satisfaction."

            "brief_description": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven efficacy for treatment of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, CBT does not help all children and those who benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion. Recent clinical trials in adults with other anxiety disorders (acrophobia and social phobia) provided support for using a medication called D-Cycloserine (DCS) to enahnce the outcome of exposure-based psychotherapy. Given this, DCS may augment CBT in youth with OCD, an anxiety disorder that is conceptually similar to acrophobia. With this in mind, the investigators are conducting a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of DCS to determine whether it had any short-term clinical benefits on CBT in youth with OCD. Forty children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD will be screened and, should they meet relevant criteria, randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: (1) CBT plus DCS, or (2) CBT plus placebo. All patients will receive 10 sessions of CBT A rater will assess participants at 3 separate time points."

            "brief_description": "The effects of multiple sclerosis (MS) on cognition, thought to occur in 50-75% of persons with MS, have gained increasing recognition as one of the major disabling symptoms of the disease. While numerous studies have addressed the emotional and physical impact of MS, little attention has been given to strategies that might help manage the cognitive changes commonly experienced by persons with MS. The proposed study will test a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention, MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, \\& Problem Solving Skills for Persons with MS). The MAPSS-MS integrates the powerful effects of group interventions to build self-efficacy for new cognitive compensatory strategies\/behaviors with individual home-based computer-assisted training. The computer training will assist individuals to develop cognitive skills that they can apply to everyday life using the compensatory strategies learned in the class sessions. In the recently completed exploratory study with 61 persons with MS (R21NR011076), the eight-week MAPSS-MS intervention was acceptable and feasible and had medium to large effects on the use of compensatory strategies and performance on neuropsychological tests of verbal memory. The proposed study will test the refined MAPSS-MS intervention with a larger more diverse sample (N=180) across multiple sites, extend the period of post-intervention follow-up to 6 months and establish whether performance improvements on neuropsychological tests make the important transfer to improved neuro-cognitive functioning in everyday life.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of the novel MAPSS-MS cognitive rehabilitation intervention to improve overall neuro-cognitive competence in activities of daily living including verbal memory performance, use of compensatory cognitive strategies and performance on cognitive-related instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with MS; (2) Evaluate the efficacy of the MAPSS-MS intervention to improve self-efficacy and related aspects of cognitive performance (non-verbal learning\/memory, information processing speed and attention, verbal fluency and complex scanning and tracking) among persons with MS; and (3) Determine the number of intervention participants who achieve and maintain their self-identified cognitive goals three and six months following the intervention. The effects of the intervention on outcome variables will be assessed using a randomized controlled trial design with a comparison group receiving usual care computer games. Measurements of study variables will occur at baseline, immediately after the MAPSS-MS intervention, and three months and six months after the intervention is complete. Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics and HLM analysis to account for the nested design. The intent-to-treat approach will be used.\n\nPublic Health Statement: This research will provide new knowledge about an innovative intervention to improve memory, use of compensatory strategies, and performance of cognitive activities and instrumental activities of daily living for persons with MS. If effective, the intervention would provide a new and feasible approach to target a serious, debilitating problem commonly experienced by persons with MS."

Most of these critical patients have medical conditions and need complex medical managements. Research findings have shown that poor healthcare teamwork would result in poor communication, missing information, and insufficient situation monitoring and thus compromise patient safety. Simulation has been proved as an effective method to develop teamwork competency. However, comparing to traditional training model, simulation requires more resources such as funding, spaces, time, administration staffs, schedule, facilitators, and equipment. It would not be easy to delivery in various professional departments. Game-based learning was a known effective and learner-centered learning model which required less resources. Researchers have shown that game-based learning has higher acceptance for the learners and can improve learners' knowledge, attitude, motivation, and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the learning effectiveness of resuscitation teamwork training of board game-based learning, simulation-based learning and lecture-based learning in PGY doctors and nurses."

Because women are more likely than men to perform SSE, women who are engaged in health promotion by having a recent screening mammogram are the focus of this research. Self-management of melanoma detection with SSE depends on ready access to dermatologists when a concerning mole is detected. In March 2020, the Illinois stay at home order (COVID-19) prohibited non-essential health care, including screening mammography and dermatology office-based care, and both are expected to remain limited until fall 2020. This submission explores a) the effectiveness of targeted melanoma detection (TMD) among women, who identify their risk of having a melanoma, learn to perform SSE, and perform SSE, and b) the effectiveness of adhesive patch-based home sample collection for genomic analysis to rule out melanoma in moles identified by women (who received the intervention) as concerning will be explored."

Theory and research suggests that correcting those common misperceptions can motivate parents to adjust their own behaviors (e.g., reducing the number of drinks they would permit), which, in turn, can impact college student drinking. Despite FITSTARTs success, the design of the program limits participation to only students who have parents who can attend on-campus orientation sessions during the summer months before the start of the Fall semester. To address this limitation and extend the previous work, the proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) will evaluate the efficacy of an online adaptation of the FITSTART(+) PBI program. To examine the efficacy of the newly developed FITSTART+ PBI web app, the proposed RCT will use a longitudinal design to examine if students self-report drinking and related negative consequences during their first semester in college significantly differed between FITSTART+ PBI (intervention app) and a control version of the app. Self-reported drinking and consequences are expected to be lower amongst students with parents randomized to FITSTART+ PBI relative to those with parents randomized to the control app."

CM components include:\n\n1. an incentive program to enhance the adolescent's engagement in the treatment process and engender alcohol abstinence by providing positive reinforcement for documented abstinence via breathalyzers administered by parents regularly at home, self and parent report, and clinic-based urine drug testing; and\n2. a parent management training program to enhance and maintain the positive effects of the incentive program by teaching parents how to effectively use contingency management in the home environment to motivate their adolescent to achieve abstinence and improve their behavior in other domains.\n\nA randomized trial will determine whether the CM intervention enhances outcomes when added to a standard individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\nSpecific Aim 2 is to determine whether and how treatment interventions modify parental and adolescent risk and protective factors using observational and laboratory measures (parenting practices, family functioning, risk taking, delay discounting, and child and parent psychopathology) and to determine whether these factors are associated with outcomes over time.\n\nSpecific Aim 3 is to test gene x environment (treatment) interactions in adolescent substance abuse. Findings will extend the scientific evidence for CM and support the ability of parents to implement CM at home. Findings that support the CM model's efficacy will make a significant contribution to research on the treatment of adolescent alcohol abuse, which has lagged behind research on adult substance abuse and on adolescent illicit drug use."

This study aims to test four different ways of presenting this potential crisis to the public, some of which are new communication strategies designed by the public themselves, to evaluate which are the most memorable and investigate the impact on behaviour change.\n\nAdults aged over 18, living in the United Kingdom, who have already signed up to a market panel research company will be eligible to participate in this study.\n\nParticipants will be invited to complete a short online survey (this should take around five minutes), advertised to them by the market research panel they have already signed up to. This survey is completely anonymous, and contains some multiple-choice questions, and some that require a short free text response. At the start of the survey one of the four ways to name AMR will be presented to participants in the form of a poster.\n\nThis study aims to result in an improved understanding regarding the general public's understanding of antibiotic use and investigate the impact of communication on behaviour change. The data from this study may be used to inform future public health campaigns on this topic and improve the use of antibiotics.\n\nThis study will be conducted online using the Predictiv platform, an online platform built by the Behavioural Insights Team. The study is being run in collaboration between the Behavioural Insights Team and the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.\n\nIs it anticipated that the survey will open in April 2024 and be open until recruitment of 4000 participants is complete.

To identify the best method to deliver fitness training, we also aimed to compare safety, tolerability, and fitness benefits between different training methods (continuous\/moderate intensity vs. interval\/alternating between low and vigorous intensity) and exercise settings (individual vs. group). Interval training reportedly facilitates higher fitness gains than continuous training. Group training may promote success through social interaction, whereas individual training offers greater flexibility.\n\nDetails of the study can be found in the publication below:\n\nPhase I\/II randomized trial of aerobic exercise in Parkinson disease in a community setting.\n\nUc EY, Doerschug KC, Magnotta V, Dawson JD, Thomsen TR, Kline JN, Rizzo M, Newman SR, Mehta S, Grabowski TJ, Bruss J, Blanchette DR, Anderson SW, Voss MW, Kramer AF, Darling WG.\n\nNeurology. 2014 Jul 29;83(5):413-25. doi: 10.1212\/WNL.0000000000000644.

            "brief_description": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that is associated with serious medical and psychological complications. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for this condition because it is highly effective in reducing the frequency of nocturnal respiratory events, improving sleep architecture, decreasing daytime sleepiness and improving blood pressure. Incomplete patient adherence, however, limits the effectiveness of CPAP therapy and results in sub-optimal patient outcomes. Previous efforts to enhance CPAP adherence have resulted in only modest improvements, have generally not been theory-driven, and have had minimal effects on key patient outcomes such as reduction in OSA symptoms or increase in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The planned intervention in this proposal, the Sleep Apnea Self-Management Program (SASMP), is based on the rationale that sleep apnea is a chronic disease that requires significant self-care on the part of the patient. We draw on the extensive chronic disease self-management literature to provide a solid theoretical justification for this pragmatic intervention both to better manage key aspects of OSA and to increase CPAP adherence. Chronic disease management programs help reduce symptoms, improve HRQOL, improve treatment adherence, and decrease medical utilization."

            "brief_description": "Estimated costs, from thirty days prior to lung transplant up through six months post surgery, exceed 1 million dollars per patient and routine medical costs average approximately fifty thousand dollars per year thereafter. Prior to transplant, lung transplant recipients self restrict activity due to severe respiratory limitations, resulting in reduced muscle mass and qualitative changes in large skeletal muscles. After transplant, despite improved lung function, studies consistently report that lung recipients fail to reach predicted physical function and physical activity. Nearly seventy percent are at risk of developing hypertension within the first five years due to side effects of immunosuppression and an inactive lifestyle worsens this risk. Consequently, full benefits of transplant may not be achieved. Few studies have tested ways to engage lung recipients in self management of exercise and adopt an active lifestyle. Lung Transplant Go LTGO is a behavioral exercise intervention that provides individualized exercise training integrated with behavioral coaching delivered in the recipient's home. Exercise training will focus on assisting lung recipients to learn and practice exercises to reverse muscle conditioning. Behavioral coaching will assist them to develop the skills to self manage physical activity in daily life and maintain this as a sustained habit using strategies that include incremental goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback and problem solving."

            "brief_description": "Early life stress (ELS) is associated with a number of psychiatric and medical conditions later in life, thought to be caused by subsequent disruptions in biological processes involved in regulation of stress responses. Given that these alterations have long-lasting effects, there is a great need for effective preventative interventions. The long-term goal of this project is to identify early interventions that may most powerfully mitigate risk for psychiatric illness among adolescents with exposure to early life stress (ELS), with a focus on interventions that can be widely and effectively implemented, have the potential for long-lasting benefits, and can effectively engage targeted neurobiological processes and networks. The specific aims of the present study are to 1) examine how ELS impacts biological processes associated with regulation of stress, and 2) identify how MBI impacts affective symptoms and biological processes dysregulated by ELS.\n\nThis study supports the efforts to reduce the effects of early adversity in children by testing an impact of an effective psychological intervention on disrupted biological processes caused by early adversity. Successful achievement of the proposed aims will contribute to a) the knowledge base needed to reduce the effects of trauma and stress in children and families and b) the development of easily implemented and disseminated preventative interventions.\n\nThe proposed study will utilize a multi-method design to examine the effect of mindfulness on biological processes (i.e., stress responses) disrupted by exposure to ELS among adolescents age 13 to 15. Adolescents will first complete self-report measures of childhood adverse experiences, trauma, and neglect. Forty eligible adolescents will be next randomly assigned to either an eight session mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention for teens or no treatment. Pre- and post-intervention assessment will include (a) self-report measures of symptoms and emotion regulation, (b) a blood draw for assessment of inflammatory markers and gene expression, and (c) a stress task with saliva cortisol collected before and after this task."

The visual system must constantly extract behaviorally relevant visual information from an abundance of irrelevant information in the visual scene. To complicate matters further, the visual feature or stimulus that is most relevant at any given moment can change quickly and frequently in realistic visual environments. The mechanisms by which task-relevant information guides perceptual behavior are not fully understood.\n\nIn this study, psychophysical experiments will be used to measure participants' ability to discriminate the horizontal position of a central object within a complex, natural visual scene, as well as to measure how that ability is affected by within-trial variability in the features of background objects in the scene.\n\nThe goal of this study is to investigate the overarching prediction that the visual system extracts task-relevant information in a manner that reflects realistically complex visual environments in which the stimuli change quickly and frequently. Specifically, this study will test the hypothesis that task-irrelevant variability in the scene affects participants' ability to discriminate the visual feature that is relevant to the task at hand."

The ability to self-regulate energy intake (eating when hungry and stopping when full) is vital to obesity prevention and it is thought that this ability can be derailed by a chronic mismatch between parental feeding behavior and the infant's state (feeding in the absence of hunger and\/or feeding beyond fullness).

MOST involves highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the effects of individual treatment components, and thereby identify which components and component levels make important contributions to the overall program effect on weight loss. This information then guides assembly of an optimized treatment package that achieves target outcomes with least resource consumption and participant burden. Because the intervention strategies being tested minimize in-person coaching and leverage technology that participants already own, the new optimized intervention, to be called Opt-IN, will be more scalable than traditional INLIs. Opt-IN will thus enjoy greatly increased reach, and enable significant progress in the fight against obesity."

            "brief_description": "The emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children is coupled with the increased prevalence of childhood obesity in the last two decades. Obesity during the adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences, including T2DM, hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial problems. The first step toward effective obesity management and T2DM prevention is monitoring of physical activity (PA) and dietary intake. With the rapid expansion of cellular networks, and advancements in smartphone technologies, it is now possible to monitor PA and dietary intake and at the same time to transmit data digitally to their primary care providers (PCP). The proposed pilot study will include the collaboration among UCSF, North East Medical Services (NEMS), mHealth teams, and overweight and\/or obese adolescents. The study will adapt and implement smartphone-based technologies and integrate these technologies with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to increase PA and dietary intake. Two specific aims of this proposed study include: (1) adapt fitbit Ultra applications for the smartphone-based technologies and EHR and (2) and assess the feasibility and estimate the effect for patient outcomes (self-efficacy, physical activity, dietary intake, BMI, and lipid profile), at 3 months post intervention between the intervention and control groups. The smartphone app for the intervention group will allow the teens to graphically compare daily PA and dietary intake with the goal, participate in a reward program where they can collect virtual points for achieving the goal, and play interactive games related to PA and diet. A total of 40 overweight and\/or obese adolescents at NEMS will be recruited and randomized to the feasibility study (Aim 2)."

Participants in Period 1 of the study were assigned to one of two groups for the duration of the study and were blinded to their group assignment until the end of the study. One group received education about tinnitus. The other group received education about tinnitus plus additional ways to cope with problems associated with tinnitus such as sleep disturbance and frustration. Participants were selected to participate if their tinnitus was severe and they had been exposed to loud sound. Participants attended up to six weekly group meetings. It was predicted that participants who were randomly assigned to the cognitive behavioral therapy group would report a greater reduction in tinnitus severity than education controls. During Period 2 of the study, a third \"standard care\" arm was added. Baseline and outcome data of the 4 participants who completed the study after this third arm was added to the study design are not reported."

            "brief_description": "Bone health is a significant public health issue in the United States. An estimated 10 million Americans age 50 and older are living with osteoporosis, and approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture in their remaining lifetime. Recent research advancements have produced effective measures to improve and maintain bone health, including exercise, diet, screening tests, pharmacotherapies, and fall prevention strategies. These findings, however, have not been fully incorporated into the daily lives of adults, and many are unaware of the magnitude of bone-health problems. Thus, greater efforts must be made to effectively disseminate evidence-based research findings to improve bone health behaviors of the public. The Internet, with its increasing popularity, can be an effective tool in this endeavor. Despite a great deal of available online health resources, there has been a lack of research investigating effective methods to package and deliver these resources to yield positive public health outcomes. Expanding upon our prior findings and using an innovative approach combining two models of the social cognitive theory (SCT) and the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance), in this proposal, we propose a large scale online study (N = 866) that will compare the long-term impact of two SCT-based online bone health interventions in adults age 50 and older targeting two large online communities. The two interventions are (1) an 8-week SCT-based Online Bone Health (TO-BoneHealth) program and (2) a 12-month TO-BoneHealth Plus program, including the TO-BoneHealth program followed by biweekly theory-based eNewsletters with follow-up of each individual's bone health behaviors (\"booster\" intervention) for 10 months. The interventions' impact will be assessed on the following the modified RE-AIM framework: (a) Effectiveness (knowledge, selected bone health behaviors, fall incidence, initiation of a discussion about bone health with a primary care provider, eHealth literacy); (b) Reach (number of participants the program reached); (c) Implementation (program usage); and (d) Maintenance (participants' bone health behavior maintenance). With the rapid growth of online communities, findings from this study will significantly contribute to current eHealth practice and research and serve as a dissemination model for other health promotion projects targeting online communities."

Individuals with an HCS who have never been diagnosed with cancer (Previvors) have up to an 80% lifetime risk of developing cancer and are at an increased risk of developing multiple primary cancers during their lifetime, often with onset at an early age. Previvors face multiple forms of adversity, including a multitude of annual cancer screenings and the uncertainty of not only their own health but the health of affected family members. This study will examine the acceptability and preliminary effects of PreCharge, a resilience-boosting solution specifically designed for Previvors and delivered primarily via bi-directional text messaging. PreCharge uses proven approaches to behavior change tailoring to increase resilience by promoting a positive mindset, strong social connections, and a deep sense of meaning and purpose while also proactively addressing scanxiety. Up to 150 Hereditary Cancer Previvors will be recruited for a 30-day pilot test. Participants will complete a baseline assessment, and then be provided with 30 days of access to the PreCharge program. At the end of the 30 days, they will be prompted to complete a follow-up assessment. Outcomes to be examined will include pre-post changes on the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale."

If successful, based on estimates that 33 to 64% of COPD patients are Internet users, the proposed exercise intervention could help over 8 million persons. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a strong commitment to providing care to persons with COPD and supporting research directed at COPD-related disability. The 2012-2016 Strategic Plan of the VHA Office of Research and Development includes research in COPD rehabilitation.

            "brief_description": "The goal of this study is to test a transdisciplinary ecological approach to reducing mental health disparities among Mexican immigrants by adapting and integrating a multilevel community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Immigrant Well-being Project, IWP) into existing efforts at three community partner organizations that focus on mental health, education, legal, and civil rights issues for Mexican immigrants. This research is innovative and significant because it employs cutting edge strategies to address social-structural determinants of mental health and examines the community-engaged process of adapting and testing the impact of a multilevel intervention originally designed for refugees. The IWP intervention emphasizes a sustainable and replicable partnership model between community-based organizations and universities that involves Mexican immigrants and undergraduate advocates working together to: a) increase immigrants' abilities to navigate their communities; b) improve immigrants' access to community resources; c) enhance meaningful social roles by valuing immigrants' culture, experiences, and knowledge; d) reduce immigrants' social isolation; and e) increase communities' responsiveness to immigrants through changes in policy and practice. The IWP is administered by university students enrolled in a service learning course, and has two elements: 1) Learning Circles, which involve cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities, and; 2) Advocacy, which involves collaborative efforts to mobilize community resources related to health, housing, employment, education, and legal issues. Studies of the intervention model with refugees demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability, and evidence that the intervention decreased participants' psychological distress and increased protective factors, and impacted changes in system-wide policies and practices. After completing in-depth ethnographic interviews with 24 Mexican immigrant adults to elucidate their mental health needs, stressors, current political\/economic\/social context, and local solutions, and a process of community engagement and intervention adaptation, a mixed methods strategy with data collected from 90 participants at four time points over a period of 14 months will be used to test the impact of the 6-month intervention on reducing psychological distress, increasing protective factors (access to resources, English proficiency, environmental mastery, and social support), and achieving system-level changes in organizational, local, and state policies and practices that impact Mexican immigrants' well-being. Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing mediating relationships between protective factors and psychological distress. Qualitative data will explore feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, participants' experiences in the intervention, and unexpected impacts; document multilevel changes and the context of implementation at each site; and inform interpretation of quantitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data on the quality of the CBPR partnerships and their relationship to multilevel outcomes will also be examined."

            "brief_description": "This randomized, controlled clinical trial will test the efficacy of Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) to improve vision function in older persons with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a highly prevalent, disabling disease of aging that causes severe vision loss and functional decline. It is the leading cause of blindness in older persons in the United States and may affect more than 10 million people. Currently, there are no effective treatments to restore vision. Thus, improving Vision Function is a major goal of treatment. Vision function refers to vision-related abilities to perform daily living activities (e.g. reading recipes to prepare meals). Decrements in vision function will become a major public health problem as the population ages and the prevalence of AMD increases. PST is a brief, standardized, cognitive-behavioral treatment that teaches problem-solving skills.\n\nWe believe PST will enable patients with AMD find practical solutions to vision-related problems and thereby improve vision function.\n\nWe will recruit 240 AMD patients from the retina clinics of Wills Eye Institute, Philadelphia, PA, with bilateral AMD and visual acuity worse than 20\/70 in the better eye. PST-trained therapists will deliver 6 1-hour, in-home sessions to the 120 subjects randomized to PST. The control treatment is Supportive Therapy (ST), a similarly structured, standardized psychological treatment that controls for the non-specific effects of treatment (n=120). ST contains no active elements beyond its non-specific components; in this way it is a placebo treatment. Independent raters, masked to treatment assignment, will assess Targeted Vision Function (primary outcome) and vision-related quality of life (secondary outcome) at 3 months to assess PST's efficacy, and at 6 months to evaluate its long-term effects. As the population ages, the disability of AMD will become more prevalent, costly, and burdensome to patients, families, and ophthalmologists. This makes devising and testing practical and affordable interventions to improve vision function a national priority."

Project TEAM is a manualized intervention co- facilitated by a disability advocate and a licensed professional. The intervention includes eight group sessions and two experiential learning field trips. In addition, young adults with disabilities serve as peer mentors on field trips and contact youth weekly to support attainment of goals. Project TEAM outcomes are to: increase youths' knowledge of environmental factors and modification strategies; reduce the impact of environmental barriers on participation; increase self-efficacy and self-determination; and increase participation in a personal activity goal in the area of education, employment, or community life. This project builds on a participatory action research partnership with disability community stakeholders to address the following research questions: (1) To what extent do youth with disabilities participating in Project TEAM achieve intervention outcomes? (2) What are the characteristics of youth with disabilities who most benefit from Project TEAM? (3) To what extent are goals, procedures, and outcomes of Project TEAM important and acceptable (socially valid) to youth with disabilities?."

            "brief_description": "Background: Multiple studies have found Atomoxetine (Strattera) to be efficacious but there is only one published study specifically designed to evaluate its efficacy in school settings. In this 7 week placebo-controlled study, Atomoxetine (ATX) at mean dose of 1.3 mg\/kg, significantly reduced teacher rated ADHD symptoms (Weiss et al., 2005). However, children are typically referred for treatment because of \"real life\" problems in functioning, not symptoms (Pelham, Fabiano, \\& Massetti, 2005). While ATX has been found to produce functional improvements at home, the Weiss study found limited results in this area at school.\n\nFurthermore, almost no research has examined the effects of combining ATX and behavior therapy (BT). In the MTA, adding BT to stimulants improved teacher ratings of hyperactivity\/impulsivity and increased the number of subjects reaching optimal response (Swanson et al., 2001). Therefore, it is possible that the addition of BT to ATX may improve functional performance in the classroom. The effects of combined therapy may be even larger for ATX as monotherapy with nonstimulants produces smaller effect sizes than with stimulants.\n\nObjective: The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of ATX alone and in combination with BT on the school functioning of 56 children ages 6-12 with ADHD. Outcomes were assessed using traditional symptoms measures as well as functional measures of academic and behavioral improvements in the classroom."

            "brief_description": "This study investigates the underlying mechanisms of a novel emotion regulation intervention among recently bereaved spouses. More specifically, this study examines how thinking about an emotional stimulus in a more adaptive way can affect the relationship between psychological stress, psychophysiological biomarkers of adaptive cardiac response, and brain activity. The emotion regulation strategy targeted is reappraisal, specifically reappraisal-by-distancing (i.e., thinking about a negative situation in a more objective, impartial way) versus reappraisal-by-reinterpretation (i.e., thinking about a better outcome for a negative situation than what initially seemed apparent).\n\nThe study seeks to determine if relatively brief, focused reappraisal training in bereaved spouses will result in reduction of self-reported negative affect, increases in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a measure of heart rate variability reflecting adaptive cardiac vagal tone), reduction in blood-based inflammatory biomarkers, and changes in neural activity over time. Reappraisal-by-distancing is expected to lead to greater changes in these variables relative to reappraisal-by-reinterpretation. Additionally, it is expected that across time decreases in self-reported negative affect, increases in RSA, reductions in blood-based inflammatory biomarker levels, and changes in neural activity will in turn lead to reductions in depressive symptoms and grief rumination. Finally, it is expected that distancing training will lead to reductions in depressive symptoms and grief rumination that are mediated by changes in the targeted neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms."

The intervention will test innovations to address both supply and demand side barriers to girls' completion of secondary school, and will have long-term educational and livelihood benefits, in addition to reducing vulnerability to HIV.\n\nSchool-based constraints will be addressed by improving academic outcomes through teacher training and academic support to students; addressing gender-related and skill-based gaps among teachers; training of local female teachers; and increasing the content knowledge of secondary school teachers. Demand side barriers will be addressed by reducing economic pressures that households face to withdraw girls' from school; building appreciation and value of girls' education; building family and community accountability for school attendance; creating safe spaces for girls and strengthening their agency; and engaging boys in promoting and supporting girls' education.\n\nPrimary stakeholders will include teachers and students, especially adolescent girls in the school (7th to 10 the standard) from marginalized communities. Secondary stakeholders will include school development and management committees (SDMCs), families, boys and the communities that are served by the schools. 80 village clusters (40 intervention; 40 control) were randomly selected from 125 village clusters in Bagalkote and Vijayapura districts. The intervention will be implemented with village communities and high schools in 40 village clusters in Bagalkote and Vijayapura districts.

We will test this hypothesis by conducting a clinical trial in which older AAs with MCI (aged 65 years and older) will be randomized to Behavior Activation (BA) (a behavioral intervention that increases participation in daily activities) or Supportive Therapy (ST) (a person-centered psychotherapy that involves active listening and offering support focusing on participants' problems and concerns).

We will measure changes in performance and regional blood oxygenation levels using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)while smokers complete tasks designed to assess decision making and response inhibition.\n\nOur primary hypothesis is that smoking abstinence will result in impaired response inhibition accompanied by decreases in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in brain regions associated with these cognitive processes including frontal cortex and the ventral striatum. Abstinence may also result in performance-related increases in activation in brain regions associated with effortful processing including the anterior cingulate cortex in effort to compensate for deficits in other regions."

This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression and HIV medication adherence in patients with opioid dependence who are receiving methadone maintenance treatment. The project is based on our pilot work with close attention to NIDA guidelines for a staged approach to treatment development and testing (Rounsaville et al., 2001).\n\nDepression is highly comorbid with both HIV infection and with opioid dependence. Depression and substance abuse are both associated with poor adherence to antiretroviral medications. Patients with HIV, depression, and opioid dependence are at high risk for poor health outcomes. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most widely studied and efficacious psychosocial intervention for depression; and research by the PI and others has shown that cognitive-behavioral interventions have been successful in promoting adherence to HIV medications."

            "title": "Three Strategies for Implementing Motivational Interviewing on Medical Inpatient Units",
            "brief_description": "General medical hospitals provide care for a disproportionate share of patients who misuse substances. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a well-recognized, evidenced-based substance use treatment. However, it is unclear which implementation strategies lead to the efficient and proficient uptake of MI in general medical settings, such as medical inpatient units. Because medical providers have multiple practice demands and time constraints, new practices have the greatest chance of being implemented if they are simple and compatible with existing workflows and systems. Two widely used strategies to bring specialized practices into use within general hospital settings are the apprenticeship model of training and use of consultation-liaison (CL) services. The apprenticeship model requires that appropriate patients and trainers are available with high flexibility for teaching and supervision; when applied to behavioral counseling approaches, this model may be incompatible with the providers' medical role and time constraints. In contrast, ordering MI through CL is relatively simple, minimally burdensome, and highly compatible with the way clinicians secure other specialist services for their patients in the hospital. This cluster randomized controlled trial examines the effectiveness of three different strategies for integrating MI into the practice of medical providers working within an academically affiliated internal medicine hospitalist service. Specifically, the trial randomizes 38 healthcare providers to one of three conditions: (1) a continuing medical education workshop that provides background and \"shows\" healthcare providers how to conduct MI (the control condition, called SEE ONE); (2) a \"see one, do one\" apprenticeship model involving workshop training plus live supervision of bedside practice (DO ONE); and (3) ordering MI from CL after learning about it in a workshop (ORDER ONE). Following the respective MI trainings, each healthcare provider will be assessed for the provision of MI to 40 study-eligible inpatients, recruited by the research team after admission to our general medical units. Trial hypotheses are 1) the percentage of MI sessions delivered by providers to study-eligible inpatients will be higher in both Do One and Order One than See One, and 2) providers in both Do One and Order One will conduct MI sessions with greater integrity than those in See One. This study is an implementation trial examining provider, not patient, outcomes."

Couple and family approaches for PTSD address relationship problems, but logistical problems make it difficult for couples to attend sessions and these approaches do not involve Veterans who are socially isolated or unmarried. There is accumulating evidence that Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for PTSD may be effective in reducing symptoms and improving interpersonal functioning.

            "brief_description": "Purpose: This study aims to take the procedural and research-based lessons learned from a pilot weight loss intervention (IRB # 13-02563-XP), conducted by The University of Tennessee Health Science Center in 2013, and apply them to the current study of 204 active duty military personnel. The pilot study translated and tailored the Look Ahead weight loss intervention to an overweight\/obese active duty U.S. Air Force population, while accommodating the lifestyle and environment that is unique to military members and evaluate materials and procedures used.\n\nRationale: Being overweight is now by far the leading medical reason for rejection in the military. Unfortunately, the impact of weight problems on the military does not stop with those turned away from military service. From 1998 to 2008, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center reported the percent of active military members who experienced medical encounters for overweight or obesity significantly increased. The estimated total days of work lost from absenteeism associated with active-duty personnel who are overweight or obese was 658,000. Using Department of Defense (DOD) estimates of average daily based, it was estimated that overweight and obesity costs the DOD $103 million dollars in health care costs annually. Note this estimate is for active duty personnel only. Furthermore, obesity is a major cause for the discharge of uniformed personnel.\n\nThe current study is inspired by the successful Look Ahead trial, a behavioral science obesity intervention treatment program that included: a collaborative approach, education, behavioral support, and motivational interviewing. The unique nature of this weight reduction study is significant. To our knowledge, there had not been a successful translation of a highly efficacious obesity treatment in the military until The University of Tennessee Health Science Center implemented a pilot version of the Fit Blue program for active duty U.S. Air Force members in 2013. Following a successful pilot and extant results from the Look Ahead trial, Investigators expect success during the full scale Fit Blue study."

            "brief_description": "The mortality rate among people with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) is 2 to 3 times that of the general population, meaning that those with a serious mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than those without an SMI. These deaths are largely attributed to preventable medical conditions, many of which are more common in the SMI population.\n\nThe \"Bridge\" intervention is a peer navigator model that was developed to target factors that negatively impact healthcare access, utilization, and outcomes among individuals with serious mental illness (e.g., severe mood disorders and psychotic disorders). This intervention targets male and female, adult consumers across races\/ethnicities and has been utilized by Pacific Clinics (Southern California's largest behavioral healthcare agency) and the Department of Mental Health of Los Angeles County to improve the health and quality of life for their consumers.\n\nInvestigators will test the comparative effectiveness of a peer navigator intervention (the Bridge) to treatment as usual. The Bridge navigator intervention is designed to teach SMI consumers the skills to engage health care providers and to overcome motivational deficits in order to improve their health and healthcare use. The specific aims of this application are:\n\n1. To use randomized methods to examine the effectiveness of the Bridge intervention on the health care utilization, satisfaction with care, health status, and health care self-management for a sample of individuals with severe mental illness receiving public mental health services in the community;\n2. To use randomized methods to examine the effectiveness of the Bridge intervention on psychological and social well-being for a sample of individuals with severe mental illness receiving public mental health services in the community.\n\n151 participants in an Full Service Partnership (FSP) clinic operated by Pacific Clinics were recruited to participate in an approximately 24-month long study of Bridge navigation. Participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment as usual (waitlist) or immediate intervention with the Bridge.\n\nParticipants in both groups will complete three assessments (baseline, 6 months, 12 months) and statistically compared over time. Staff stakeholders (n = 20) will also be interviewed at baseline and every three months of the study in order to ensure that the intervention is being implemented appropriately."

            "brief_description": "Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), colloquially known as Long COVID, is a prevalent phenomenon that affects thousands of Veterans in VA care. VA patients suffering from Long COVID not only experience lingering physical symptoms following COVID-19 infection, but have increased mental health problems including sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders as well as increased use of opioid and non-opioid pain medications, antidepressants, and sedatives to treat these conditions. Developing recovery-oriented care, \"a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential\" is a VA priority, however available Long COVID treatments primarily target symptom relief and are not designed to promote the recovery and rehabilitation of Veterans in a mental health context. Long COVID Coping and Recovery (LCCR) is a promising manualized, recovery-focused psychotherapeutic group intervention which aims to improve psychological adjustment to Long COVID symptoms, promote resilience, and facilitate coping, based on established psychotherapeutic techniques such as skills training, acceptance-based and identity-based principles.\n\nThe investigators will assess rates of recruitment, intervention engagement, and session attendance (feasibility), Veteran satisfaction (acceptability), treatment adherence (fidelity) and preliminarily explore response to Long COVID Coping and Recovery (LCCR). Findings will be used to make a final adaptation of the treatment materials and to develop a research protocol for a large scale RCT of LCCR for Veterans with Long COVID. This study will pilot test a well-specified, group-based intervention tailored to the unique needs of Veterans with Long COVID. The results of the proposed study will provide data to 1) identify adaptations needed to optimize LCCR for Veterans with Long COVID; 2) identify possible benefits of LCCR; 3) inform development of a large scale RCT of LCCR for Veterans with Long COVID."

In addition, empirical evidence suggests that some mental disorders are more prevalent in Veterans than in the general population. Linking unemployment and mental illness, a recent study found that 65% of Veterans using VA healthcare were unemployed, and compared to employed Veterans, the unemployed were more likely to have depression, bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, or substance use disorders. Vocational dysfunction was reported most often in disabled Veterans with schizophrenia, PTSD, and substance use disorders. Not surprisingly, this study also found that unemployed Veterans had significantly lower income than employed persons. Similarly, a large study focusing specifically on Veterans with PTSD concluded that vocational dysfunction is a notable problem among this group, as they were significantly less likely to be employed after participating in VA work programs compared with participants without the disorder. Because most individuals with mental illness desire to work in regular competitive employment, the nationwide problem of unemployment among Veterans with mental illness is particularly troubling.\n\nThe VA is addressing this need by implementing supported employment (SE), a psychiatric rehabilitation approach that provides individual vocational assistance to Veterans with mental illness. While the SE model is empirically validated and SE programs have been shown to achieve partial success in improving employment outcomes, a sizable proportion of individuals, 40% or more, remain unemployed. A further challenge is job retention; Veterans with mental illness who obtain jobs frequently struggle to maintain them long-term. Even in the context of high quality, evidence-based vocational services, most studies show only modest job retention of a few months, and consequently, frequent job losses and inconsistent vocational functioning remain a substantial and unsolved problem.\n\nRationale: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces symptoms across a range of psychiatric conditions; however, its benefit to functioning remains less well understood. Work functioning has received little empirical attention in the CBT domain. Despite research evidence suggesting that maladaptive thoughts about oneself and expectations about the ability to work interfere with work success, no CBT programs have been developed specifically targeting vocational themes with the goal of improving competitive work outcomes. Further, a recent paper outlined needed avenues of future study in the SE domain; Drake and Bond (2011) state that cognitive strategies may be a fruitful area to develop to help \"nonresponder\" consumers with mental illness who struggle with vocational dysfunction despite high quality vocational assistance. The goal of the current project is to address this gap and the serious problem of unemployment in Veterans with mental illness by pilot testing the CBT for work success program (CBTw) and assessing key employment outcomes before and after the intervention, and six months after conclusion of the intervention.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nAim 1: Test the preliminary efficacy of the CBTw program on key Veteran employment and psychosocial outcomes utilizing a pre\/post design.\n\nAim 2: Further assess the feasibility of the program, including recruitment, retention rates, and program participation rates.\n\nAim 3: Gauge effect sizes in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of the CBT program in routine practice settings"

Mi Puente utilizes a sustainable nurse + volunteer peer team-based model, bridging partnership between inpatient and outpatient care settings to meet the integrated (i.e., physical and behavioral) health needs of Hispanics who are hospitalized with multiple chronic cardiometabolic conditions and one or more behavioral health concern(s).

The proposed randomized controlled trial will test Mi Puente versus Usual Care (evidence-based, best practice discharge procedures) in improving hospital utilization, patient-reported, and cost effectiveness outcomes.

The problem of obesity is as great in veterans as it is in the general public. Adherence to dietary therapy for obesity is often inadequate, possibly because patients' food preferences are not considered during dietary counseling. Allowing patients to choose a diet based on their food preferences may increase their motivation to adhere to diet counseling. This, in turn, could enhance their weight loss success and, ultimately, reduce the many health complications and costs of obesity. The proposed study will examine whether assessing a person's food preferences, and then allowing the person to choose from two commonly prescribed diets, results in greater weight loss success."

This project aims to address these barriers, and subsequently reduce heavy alcohol use and increase engagement in HIV care, through an intervention in which counselors provide individual and group counseling to increase motivation, while also addressing structural barriers to care through increased opportunities for savings and increased social support. This may be a feasible approach to help this hard-to-reach population reduce drinking and increase access care, which could ultimately reduce mortality rates, improve treatment outcomes, and through its effect on HIV viral load, decrease the likelihood of transmitting HIV to others."

N\/E is based on Fort Peck tribal members' desire to implement a holistic SRH intervention for American Indian youth. N\/E includes: 1) A school-based SRH curriculum called Native Stand, designed to address individual-level factors that lead to sexual risk behaviors; 2) a family-level curriculum called Native Voices, tailored to increase communication between adult family members and youth about SRH topics; 3) a cultural mentoring component at the community level that pairs American Indian youth with adults and elders to discuss traditional American Indian beliefs and practices about SRH; and 4) a mobilizing strategy to activate a multi-sectoral network of youth-servicing organizations at the systems level in Fort Peck to coordinate SRH services for American Indian youth. The overarching aim of this proposal is to refine, tailor, and finalize the components of N\/E and evaluate its efficacy. We will use a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design (SWD), in which 5 schools that American Indian youth from Fort Peck attend are the clusters to be randomized into the intervention 1 at a time, with all schools eventually being randomized to the intervention. The 5 schools are located in separate communities, mitigating the potential for cross-contamination. N\/E is a 5-year study involving 456 14- to 18-year-old American Indian youth."

Yet, these decisions are important because disclosures can lead to reactions from others that harm or help recovery. For example, stigmatizing responses can harm the mental health of people in recovery whereas supportive responses can strengthen people's commitment to their sobriety. We have developed a brief intervention to help people decide whether and how to tell others about their recovery as well as build skills for disclosure. The purpose of this study is to pilot test this intervention and test its acceptability and feasibility as well as determine if it shows preliminary signs of efficacy in comparison to a control condition. We hypothesize that: (1) participants exposed to the intervention condition will agree that the intervention is acceptable and feasible, and (2) participants in the intervention condition will report higher quality decision making in comparison to participants in the control condition."

However, CBT is largely underutilized within Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) due to the cost and burden of trainings necessary to deliver the large number of CBT protocols. Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT), in contrast, is specifically designed to address numerous distinct disorders within a single protocol. The transdiagnostic approach of TBT has the potential to dramatically improve the accessibility of CBT within VAMCs and therefore improve clinical outcomes of Veterans. The proposed research seeks to evaluate the efficacy of a group version of TBT (G-TBT) by assessing clinical outcomes and quality of life in VAMC patients with major depressive disorder and PTSD throughout the course of treatment and in comparison to two existing group disorder-specific therapies (G-DST), CBT for Depression and Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD."

            "brief_description": "Seat belts protect people from injuries by diverting crash forces to stronger anatomical structures: the rib cage and the pelvis. Children between the ages of 4 and 8 years are typically not tall enough to wear the seat belt correctly across the chest and hips, and instead wear it on their abdomen and neck. When worn in this way, seat belts direct crash forces to these parts of the body, potentially causing serious damage to internal organs and the spine. For this reason, children of these ages need to use a booster seat; a safety device that prevents seat belt related injuries by raising the child and ensuring the straps are correctly worn across the thorax and hips. In Canada, half of the children who should be using booster seats are prematurely restrained using only the seat belt. The present research project seeks to develop and test a novel intervention to encourage booster seat use.\n\nMany Canadian provinces have enacted laws mandating use, and have developed and implemented evidence-based education programs. Despite these efforts, new approaches to encourage booster seat use are required. In 2010, more than 10 years after booster seats became mandatory, the rate of utilization in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec was still low (25%). Furthermore, recent research indicates that parents' perception of the safety benefit of booster seats is the strongest predictor of use, yet no study to date has tested an education intervention that increases perceived benefit; instead, these interventions focus on teaching guidelines (i.e., minimum and maximum age, height, and weight to determine when a child should use a booster seat, and when it is safe for a child to use only the seat belt).\n\nThe present approach to encouraging booster seat use is novel, because it increases perceived benefit by teaching two principles: (1) seat belts prevent injuries by redirecting crash forces to stronger parts of the body (rib cage and pelvis); and (2), without booster seats, children would wear the seat belt on their abdomen and neck, which directs crash forces to more vulnerable anatomical structures (internal organs and spine). Once parents grasp these two principles, they are expected to better appreciate the safety benefit of booster seats and, thus, be more likely to use them."

These brief interactions with prescribers are frequently provider-driven with insufficient time focused on the patient's needs and personal recovery. Shared decision making is a strategy that could improve this interaction. This study examines how technology can be used in the care process to amplify the voice of the patient, support shared decisions, and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nInvestigators will compare the effectiveness of Measurement-Based vs. Person-Centered Care on two primary patient-centered outcomes: the patient experience of care with medication treatment and the level of shared decision making. Investigators hypothesize that:\n\n1. Person-Centered Care will result in greater improvement in patient experience of care with medication treatment than Measurement-Based Care.\n2. Person-Centered Care will result in a greater level of shared decision making during the medication visit than Measurement-Based Care.\n\nThe study team will collect information from patients, caregivers, and clinic staff at different points in time during the study. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires, and additional data on their service use will be gathered. Some patients and providers will also be interviewed about their experiences with care. Investigators are especially interested to learn if and how these two approaches are perceived to change medication treatment, if patients are more satisfied and empowered in their care, and why and how providers perceive and adopt changes to their clinical care."

            "brief_description": "Many soldiers returning from their recent service in Operation Iraqi Freedom\/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF\/OEF) were exposed to blasts during combat. About 60% of blast-injured soldiers are diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI), with approximately 18% having a mild TBI (mTBI). mTBI is associated with many symptoms, including memory problems, headaches, difficulty concentrating, increased anxiety, and, especially relevant here, reports of difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments and\/or when people speak rapidly. While problems understanding rapid speech or speech in noise are associated with hearing loss, many of the OIF\/OEF veterans with these complaints have clinically normal hearing. Although there is no physical damage to their ears, these veterans' hearing problems have a negative impact on their quality-of-life and functioning. Thus it is incumbent upon the VA to examine intervention approaches for veterans with normal\/near-normal auditory sensitivity and significant complaints of difficulty hearing. Currently, there is no standard-of-care for these veterans other than providing information about hearing, hearing conservation, and the use of communication strategies. Two forms of rehabilitation likely to be more effective than such an informational-counseling approach are: (1) the use of personal miniaturized Frequency modulation (FM) systems, and (2) the provision of auditory training with Posit Science Brain Fitness Program (BFP). Personal FM systems increase the loudness of the speech signal relative to that of the unwanted noise, while the BFP training improves the ability to listen by taking advantage of the brain's ability to change (i.e., neural plasticity). In this study veterans will randomly be selected to receive one of four treatments: (1) FM use alone, (2) BFP training alone, (3) FM+BFP training combined, and (4) informational-counseling. The effectiveness of the interventions will be compared using self-report of hearing functioning on standard questionnaires. Results will contribute to the development of evidence-based intervention approaches for blast-exposed veterans with reported functional hearing difficulties and normal\/near-normal auditory sensitivity."

            "brief_description": "Community-dwelling older adults fear loss of independence and nursing home placement more than death. Walking difficulty often leads to loss of independence. Exercise is beneficial to physical and mental health and may prevent walking difficulty and promote independence. Recognizing the importance of exercise, senior housing facilities offer exercise programs to their residents. The exercise programs are often group-based, seated range of motion exercises that do not challenge the older adult; consequently participation rates and resident satisfaction are low.\n\nIf the goal is to improve walking to promote independence than the exercise program should specifically target walking. Therefore, we developed a challenging, group exercise program entitled \"On the Move\" which focuses on the fundamentals of walking. In this research study we will determine if the On the Move program is better than a standard program at improving walking and promoting independence and if the same benefits can be obtained if the On the Move program is delivered by staff of the senior living facilities instead of an exercise leader. To answer these questions, 400 community-dwelling older adults living in 32 different Independent Living Facilities and Senior High Rises or living in the community and attending senior community centers will be randomly assigned to either the 12 week On the Move group exercise program or the standard group exercise program delivered by either an exercise leader or staff activity personnel. Participants' walking and reported ability to carry out everyday activities (functional ability) will be assessed before and after the 12 week program. We will also assess participant safety and satisfaction with the exercise program and instructor.\n\nThe findings from this research study will provide evidence for the value of the On the Move group exercise program and will better inform patient choices regarding participation in exercise programs. If successful in improving walking and promoting independence and acceptable to the older adult, the On the Move program could be incorporated into exercise programming for older adults in community centers, health clubs, and senior residences across the country."

This study will examine the effect of the EHR-based intervention to improve quality of palliative care for patients 55 years or older with chronic, life-limiting illness with a particular emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The specific aims are:\n\n1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel EHR-based (electronic health record) clinician Jumpstart guide, compared with usual care, for improving the quality of care; the primary outcome is documentation of a goals-of-care discussion in the period between randomization and 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes focus on intensity of care: ICU use, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs of care during the hospitalization, and 7 and 30-day hospital readmissions.\n2. To conduct a mixed-methods evaluation of the implementation of the intervention, guided by the RE-AIM framework for implementation science, incorporating quantitative evaluation of the intervention's reach and adoption, as well as qualitative analyses of interviews with participants, to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination."

The components of these interventions will be designed to address specific barriers to vaccination identified by literature search and our prior work in the area of community-based vaccine education. Both arms will focus primarily on pneumococcal disease and zoster but will include limited content on influenza because participants are likely to have questions about how the flu and its vaccination differ from pneumococcal diseases and zoster.

            "brief_description": "Opioid prescription drug abuse has become a major public health concern in the United States with mortality rates from fatal overdoses reaching epidemic proportions. This opioid crisis coincides with national efforts to improve management of chronic non-cancer pain. The net result, however, has been ever-growing increases in medical expenditures related to prescription costs and increased healthcare service utilization among opioid abusers. Healthcare provider prescribing pattern, especially among non-pain management specialists such as primary care, is a major factor. Louisiana is a major contributor to the epidemic with the 7th highest opioid prescribing rates accompanied by a 12% increase in fatal overdoses.\n\nProviders are overdue for implementing safe opioid management strategies in primary care to combat the opioid crisis. Recent practice guidelines provide recommendations on what to do for safe prescribing of opioids, but they do not provide guidance on how to translate them into practice. Health systems must find ways to accelerate guideline adoption in primary care in the face of an overdose crisis. Research that examines a combination workflow- and provider-focused strategies are needed. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders among patients with chronic non-cancer pain, care team expansion with integration of collaborative mental\/behavioral health services may be the solution. Collaborative care can extend opioid management beyond standardized monitoring of risk factors for opioid misuse or abuse and set clear protocols for next steps in management.\n\nThis study is aligned with the National Institute on Drug Abuse's interest in health systems research that examines approaches to screening, assessment, prevention, diagnosis and treatment for prescription drug abuse. It will examine the primary care practice redesign of managing chronic non-cancer pain within a large health system whose 40+ Accountable Care Network-affiliated, adult primary care clinics may serve as an example for transforming opioid management in primary care practices across the country. This four-year type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial is designed to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of electronic medical record-based clinical decision support guided care versus additional integrated, stepped collaborative care for opioid management of primary care patients with chronic non-cancer pain (clinical pharmacist for medication management; licensed clinical social worker for cognitive behavioral therapy and community health worker care coordination); and to examine facilitators and barriers to implementing this multi-component intervention. Investigators anticipate that our study results will elucidate the role of technology versus care team optimization in changing provider opioid prescribing behaviors. Investigators further anticipate that results of our study will demonstrate that integrated mental\/behavioral health care for opioid management of chronic non-cancer pain increases value-based care and leads to greater efficiencies in the way that care is delivered."

            "brief_description": "Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25% of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline, delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of motivation\/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model, social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle. It involves a four-step approach that includes: (1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2) Education; (3) Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff, Patients and Families. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT within 12 hospitals in Maryland and Pennsylvania randomized to FFC-AC-EIT or Function Focused Care Education Only (EO) with 50 patients recruited per hospital (total sample 600 patients). Aim 1 will focus on efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity, function, and participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use of tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers) along with emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge; and at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate function and physical activity at 6, 12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-EIT will be compared with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost and cost savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO. Findings will address several prioritized areas of research: a focus on ADRD; improving physical function; and training of hospital staff and will demonstrate efficacy of an approach to care for patients with ADRD that can be disseminated and implemented across all acute care facilities."

The FCU is a school-based family-centered intervention that has been developed over the past 20 years and tested across the United States with diverse populations. It focuses on enhancing parenting skills and family management in early adolescence. The FCU has been shown to be highly effective at reducing adolescent problem behavior, achievement problems, depression, and substance use over an extended period of time.\n\nIn the original FCU, parents complete an assessment that evaluates family strengths and challenges. They then receive feedback from a family consultant about how their data compare to other families with children of the same age. As part of this feedback session, the consultant helps motivate parents to make changes at home that will positively impact their child and family overall. Parents and consultants decide together which child behaviors they most want to see change. The consultant then works with parents to enhance relevant parenting and family management skills.\n\nDespite the demonstrated effectiveness of this intervention, few schools have the resources and staffing to implement it without substantial support. It seems, then, that schools would benefit from an online package that requires fewer school resources to implement. The FCU-Online is designed to incorporate the successful components of the original FCU while reducing the burden on schools. And, because it is accessed online, parents can utilize this resource at a time and location convenient to them.\n\nIn this study, 300 families will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a web\/ mobile-only version of the FCU, a web\/mobile + coach version, or middle school as usual. Research on mental health interventions delivered over the internet suggests that a coach or \"in-person\" contact enhances outcomes. However, programs that require no coaching or in-person contact are cheaper and easier for schools to deliver. Therefore, a web\/ mobile-only version may allow more schools to deliver the intervention to a greater number of families and children. Thus, investigators will test the relative effectiveness of a coach version versus an online-only version at improving key parenting skills. It is predicted that changes in parenting will lead to reductions in risk behavior, such as problem behavior at school and substance use."

One promising approach is to implement Illness Management and Recovery (IMR), a structured curriculum to help mental health consumers manage their illnesses and pursue goals related to recovery from mental illness.\n\nIMR was developed from a review of effective approaches for illness self-management training in persons with severe mental illness. The 9-month curriculum is taught using motivational, educational, and cognitive-behavioral techniques, and incorporates five evidence-based practices: education about mental illness, strategies for increasing medication adherence, skills training to enhance social support, relapse prevention planning, and coping skills training. The program was developed for widespread dissemination and includes a manual, worksheets, an introductory video, a clinical training video, a fidelity scale, and informational brochures for consumers, family members, clinicians, and administrators."

            "brief_description": "Patients whose kidneys fail generally require dialysis treatments to sustain life. The ability of patients to make major adjustments in their lives for dialysis is hampered by depression that affects almost one-quarter of such individuals. There are no studies that have adequately tested whether treatment of depression is effective in dialysis patients and if there is any difference between the response to the two most commonly available forms of treatment, psychotherapy and anti-depressant drug therapy.\n\nTo fill this important gap in the investigators knowledge, the investigators propose to undertake (1) a randomized controlled clinical trial of 200 patients to test whether an engagement interview will result in a higher proportion of dialysis patients accepting treatment for depression; and (2) a randomized controlled clinical trial of 120 patients to determine whether there is any difference in the likelihood of improvement of depressive symptoms with psychotherapy or drug therapy among dialysis patients with depression. Patients in these studies will be enrolled from among individuals receiving care in 50 dialysis facilities in three metropolitan areas - Seattle, Dallas, and Albuquerque. The research proposal has been developed with the support of patients, caregivers, and stakeholders to ensure that the findings from the study are relevant to them and can be readily implemented in day-to-day clinical practice. Hence, the engagement interview and psychotherapy will be delivered in a dialysis facility to ease the burden on patients, and the dose of the study drug will be changed in partnership with the study participants. In addition to depressive symptoms, the effect of treatment on other meaningful outcomes such as fatigue and sleep will be determined.\n\nThe two forms of treatment for depression being tested in this clinical trial are very different from each other and patients differ with regards to the treatment option preferable and\/or available to them. Successful completion of the clinical trial will provide patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders with the information that they would need when faced with a diagnosis of depression in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This will allow patients to select evidence-based treatments to improve outcomes that are relevant to them."

Weight loss combined with exercise may reduce inflammation and may improve physical functioning in older adults who are overweight or obese and sedentary. However, the mechanisms by which weight change and exercise influence physical functioning and sarcopenia remain largely understudied. ions). In the WL+E group, participants attended a group-based weight management session plus three supervised exercise sessions each week throughout the entire study. During each exercise session, participants engaged in both aerobic activities (i.e., walking) and lower body resistance training of moderate intensity. The participants in the educational control group attended monthly health education lectures on topics relevant to older adults. It was hypothesized that participants assigned to the WL+E intervention would 1) lose a larger amount of weight, 2) improve their physical function levels, and 3) reduce levels of oxidative stress and inflammation to a greater degree than participants assigned to the Educational Control group. Outcomes are: 1) body weight, 2) walking speed (assessed by 400 meter walk test), 3) the Short Physical Performance Battery \\[SPPB\\], and 4) knee extension isokinetic strength. The objectives of this pilot study are fourfold: 1) to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the proposed WL+E intervention in a sample of 40 sedentary, obese older adults with impaired physical functioning; 2) to examine the biological effects of the intervention on inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, apoptosis, sarcopenia, muscle and body composition, muscle strength, and functional performance; 3) to determine whether the expected beneficial effects of the WL+E intervention on physical functioning are mediated by changes in inflammation, apoptosis, and sarcopenia; and 4) to determine the effect size of the WL+E intervention on key outcomes and provide the basis for sample size calculations in the planning of a larger RCT."

In addition to traditional rehabilitation such as physical and occupational therapy, a number of alternative treatments are now being studied for their ability to enhance patients' recovery following stroke. One of these treatments, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction or MBSR, involves an 8-week course that teaches individuals strategies such as breathing techniques, meditation, and movement therapy. The current study proposes to teach MBSR to a group of Veterans with a history of stroke to determine whether this type of intervention has beneficial effects on psychological and cognitive functioning.

One component of the current FBT programused in this study that has received little attention is thought training, specifically episodic future thinking (EFT). EFTteaches individuals to pre-experience events, or think prospectively, about future events as if they were happeningnow and has been shown to reduce delay discounting (DD) which is defined as discounting smaller rewards now for a larger reward in the \\[Daniel, Said, Stanton, \\& Epstein\\]. Furthermore, EFT has been shown to help people purchase fewer calories when they are grocery shopping \\[Hollis-Hansen et al., 2019\\], thereby displaying potential to be an effective measure in modulating the food environment in homes and may play a role in changing eating behaviors related to weight loss \\[Appelhaus et al.,2019\\].\n\nGiven the power of EFT in promoting the purchase of fewer calories, it is plausible that EFT training focused around grocery shopping during FBT could help shift one's thought processes towards healthier food choices, promoting behavioral change that has lasting impact on the home environment. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to assess whether EFT training promotes active behavioral change pertaining to grocery shopping during FBT. In turn,this resulting behavior change could lead to healthier eating behavior and may promote weight loss for the whole family.\n\nWe hypothesize:\n\n* There will be a reduction in BMI for adults\/percent over BMI for children and weight from baseline\n* There will be a reduction in delay discounting for children"

In sequence, this pilot study and larger RCT are grounded in the PRECEDE-PROCEED implementation science framework. The pilot study has four components: 1) a qualitative component will be used to design a docu-drama, 2) key informant interviews to guide intervention development, 3) a simultaneous randomized pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility of the larger trial design of communication interventions using WhatsApp compared to control, and 4) a final mixed- methods (quantitative survey and focus groups) assessment of participant views of acceptability, effectiveness, feasibility and cultural appropriateness of the two proposed communication interventions.\n\nOBJECTIVES The three objectives of this pilot study are the careful design of a novel docu- drama communication intervention and WhatsApp intervention, evaluation of the feasibility of a larger RCT of communication strategies, and assessment of participant views of the two proposed communication interventions and control among first time blood donors within the catchment areas of the SZBC.\n\nFor the purposes of registration for clinicaltrials.gov only the randomized pilot trial communication interventions using WhatsApp compared to control is reported.\n\nThe planned sample size for the pilot RCT is n=128 first-time blood donors.\n\nThe study population for the pilot RCT is first-time voluntary non-remunerated blood donors (VNRBD) and family\/replacement blood donors (FRD) from the SZBC catchment area.\n\nREGIMEN WhatsApp: Participants assigned to the WhatsApp group will receive weekly messages developed by communication specialists aimed to motivate blood donation, be encouraged to discuss their blood donation experiences, and share their own motivations for donating blood in a moderated, closed group over a six-month duration. The moderator will provide guidelines on acceptable use of WhatsApp in the group, including images they can or cannot share. Participants will also receive standard NBSG communications for first-time donors.\n\nControl: Participants in this group will receive the standard NBSG communications for first-time donors: 1) a thank you phone call and 2) and a reminder phone call two-weeks prior to the second blood donation eligibility. The second blood donation eligibility is four months after the first donation."

The app targets provides tips, messages, and strategies to overcome common barriers older adults face to being physically active. Participants will include older adults with memory or thinking problems or those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild forms of dementia who are smartphone users age 65 years or older and who are not meeting nationally recommended levels of physical activity. In the clinical trial phase of this study, 15 participant-study partner dyads will be oriented to the app and use it for a two-month period. Dyads will keep a diary to document their experiences and participants' activity patterns will also be tracked at the beginning and end of the study. After the two-month app trial is complete, dyads will return for a follow-up interview to discuss their experiences and provide suggestions for app improvements. Findings from this stage of the overall study will be combined with previous study phases to derive specifications for an optimized app for older people with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia."

AD-MIL will be compared to Present Centered Therapy (PCT). AD-MIL is a modified version of Adaptive Disclosure (AD), which has been modified and extended to solely treat MI and TL by targeting psychological and behavioral obstacles to occupational, relationship, and family functioning, as well as quality of life. PCT is a manualized evidenced-based PTSD treatment used to address functioning problems in several large-scale PTSD trials. The primary end-point was psychosocial functioning (improvements in social, educational and occupational functions). Secondary end-points included PTSD, depression, moral emotions (anger, shame, and guilt), alcohol use, self-compassion, and mindful\/valued living."

The purpose of this study is to test a new, more patient-centered approach to colon cancer screening. In older individuals (ages 70 to 75) who are \"due\" for screening, the investigators will provide education on the benefits and harms of colon cancer screening. But instead of simply providing these patients with \"average\" information about these benefits, the investigators will give them information that takes into account their personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender), overall health, and screening history and therefore applies to them more personally. The investigators will also work with the health system to create time and space for patient and doctor to discuss whether screening is the right choice for each individual. This way, patients can make an informed choice about what is right for them, with the help of their doctor. In the future, the results of this study will help patients make more informed screening decisions, especially when the benefits of screening may be uncertain for them personally."

Puerto Rican adolescents, in particular, experience disparities in these areas, yet few adolescent and even fewer parent interventions have been developed to address these important issues with this underserved population. Parent-adolescent programs are an effective approach to reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior and associated negative consequences. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to strengthen and enhance programs that are designed for adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions, and to increase parents' access to sexual health education programs by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions (e.g., low cost, can be viewed privately, at parents convenience, minimizes competing time with work and family). The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief theoretically informed (i.e., Ecodevelopmental Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action\/Planned Behavior, Social Cognitive Theory 1-6), culturally appropriate, and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program, Cu\u00eddalos (\"Take care of them\"), designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an NIH funded R21 randomized control trial (RCT) testing a brief computer-based version of the Cu\u00eddalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos. Further, despite limited or no previous computer use, parents reported they liked and learned from the program, and that it was easy to use and accessible."

A limited but growing body of evidence suggests that screening for and addressing these needs - also referred as social determinants of health -- in clinic settings helps to connect patients to resources to address unmet needs and has the potential to improve health outcomes. Veterans carry a high burden of unmet needs. At present, VA systematically screens for only two unmet needs; homelessness and food insecurity. The investigators propose to assess the efficacy of systematically screening Veterans for nine unmet needs (i.e., housing, food insecurity, utility insecurity, transportation, legal problems, employment, safety, stress, and social isolation), and compare the effect of referral mechanisms of varying intensity on Veterans' connection to resources, reduction of unmet needs, treatment adherence, reduced preventable hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes."

However they will not undergo any subsequent motivational interview. Following the initial clinic visit, all subjects with ongoing seizures will either be scheduled for ongoing psychotherapy for treatment of PNES at Brigham and Women's Hospital or referred to a local psychotherapist according to their preference.\n\nAll subjects will be contacted by phone at 3 month follow-up. If necessary they will be called 5 times at various times during the day and early evening. If they are not reached, they will receive a letter requesting them to contact the study staff to complete the study. Subjects will be questioned about their adherence to treatment. The primary outcome will be the number of psychotherapy sessions for the treatment of PNES in which they have participated over the past three months. They will also be assessed for secondary outcomes including dichotomous adherence (either seizure freedom or active participation in psychotherapy for the treatment of PNES, with more than 5 sessions over the past 3 months), seizure frequency over the past month, number of hospitalizations and emergency department visits over the past 3 months, and quality of life as measured by the brief QOLIE-10 instrument. For those patients who give permission, their psychotherapists will be contacted by study staff to confirm the exact number of psychotherapy sessions over the past 3 months. A standard Partners clinical records release form with the patient's signature will be sent to the therapist's office."

Individuals with BDD have very poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of hospitalization and suicidality. Because BDD differs in important ways from other disorders, psychotherapies for other disorders are not adequate for BDD. Despite BDD's severity, there is no adequately tested psychosocial treatment (psychotherapy) of any type for this disorder.

The investigators will adapt a successful intervention tested in the Health Literacy and Cancer Screening Project by adding a follow-up strategy to the health literacy intervention. Specific Aims: The investigators Primary Aims are to: 1. Compare the effectiveness of the PC and ATR strategies to improve initial and repeat CRC screening. 2. Compare the cost effectiveness of the PC and ATR strategies for initial and repeat CRC screening. The investigators Secondary Aims are to: 3. Conduct a process evaluation of both follow-up strategies to investigate implementation and barriers 4. Determine if the effects of either strategy vary by patients' literacy skills. 5. Explore patient characteristics associated with CRC screening knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and compliance over time between study arms."

PROTECT is built on a model which postulates that chronic stress promotes dysfunction of the cognitive control (CCN) and reward networks, impairing the victims' ability to flexibly respond to the environment and limits their reward activities. PROTECT therapists work with victims to develop action plans to reduce stress, and to increase rewarding experiences. EM\/PROTECT has been designed in an iterative process with community EM providers of the New York City (NYC) Department for the Aging (DFTA) to use agencies' routine PHQ-9 depression screening and referral for service. In the current study, the investigators will compare the effectiveness of EM\/PROTECT with EM enriched with staff training in linking EM victims to community mental health services (EM\/MH). The investigators intend to enroll 80 subjects that will participate in the study for approximately 12 weeks."

Diabetes-related medical problems and stress often happen together and affect peoples' ability to live a full, happy and healthy life. Because of this, programs that help with medical problems and stress by teaching ways to better manage diabetes and stress may improve the lives of those with diabetes.\n\nMany excellent programs are available in the VA and in the community that help persons with diabetes better manage their medical problems and stress, but often times Veterans have trouble finding these programs.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to see if a telephone-based coaching program improves the physical and emotional health of Veterans with diabetes more than use of a directory of community and VA resources and no coaching. The Veterans who receive the directory of community and VA resources will be given this at the beginning of the study and will access resources as they see fit. Those in the coaching program will be coached by a Veteran with knowledge of diabetes, mental health and community resources who will help them connect to care in the VA and\/or community depending on their preference. Examples of resources available in the VA and community include mental health care and programs to help with diet, exercise and learning about how to better manage diabetes.\n\nVeterans who are interested in participating and pass screening will be enrolled in the study for about 6 months. Each enrolled Veteran will have a 50% chance of being enrolled in the coaching group and a 50% chance of being enrolled in the directory group (like the flip of a coin). Both groups will be asked to complete several questionnaires about their health and well-being by telephone. This will occur at the beginning of the study and three and six months later. The questionnaires will take about an hour to complete each time."

Although having variant ALDH2 alleles is protective against heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders, for those who do drink, these variants also are associated with elevations in risk for several health problems. The premise of this study is that we can affect early drinking behavior through personalized communication about these health-related risks."

            "brief_description": "Obesity and physical inactivity have reached epidemic proportions, resulting in increased rates of a variety of chronic diseases, increased risk of death, and substantial health care costs. Individuals with serious mental illness are even more likely to be overweight or obese, which contributes to the high rate of co-morbid medical disease and early mortality found among this population. Specific individual and group-based psychoeducational interventions have repeatedly and consistently been shown to help adults with serious mental illness improve their weight. However, these require substantial time from mental health clinicians, and frequent visits by patients to mental health clinics. This creates challenges for patients who may need to travel to a medical center that provides these services, and who often have limited transportation options. It is likely that these barriers can be addressed with a computerized, web-based intervention focused on diet and exercise education, and tailored for veterans with serious mental illness. Web-based systems can deliver content that is intensive, engaging, and tailored to the needs and preferences of specific patients. Web-based systems can be delivered using computers at community-based outpatient Clinics or other settings in the community. The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based intervention to help patients with serious mental illness lose weight."

            "brief_description": "Children with speech sound disorder show diminished accuracy and intelligibility in spoken communication and may thus be perceived as less capable or intelligent than peers, with negative consequences for both socioemotional and socioeconomic outcomes. While most speech errors resolve by the late school-age years, between 2-5% of speakers exhibit residual speech errors (RSE) that persist through adolescence or even adulthood, reflecting about 6 million cases in the US. Both affected children\/families and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) have highlighted the critical need for research to identify more effective forms of treatment for children with RSE. In a series of single-case experimental studies, research has found that treatment incorporating technologically enhanced sensory feedback (visual-acoustic biofeedback, ultrasound biofeedback) can improve speech in individuals with RSE who have not responded to previous intervention. Further research is needed to understand heterogeneity across individuals in the magnitude of response to biofeedback treatment.\n\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to conduct clinical research that will guide the evidence-based management of RSE while also providing novel insights into the sensorimotor underpinnings of speech. The central hypothesis is that individual deficit profiles will predict relative response to visual-acoustic vs ultrasound biofeedback. From the larger population of children with RSE evaluated as part of C-RESULTS-RCT (Correcting Residual Errors With Spectral, Ultrasound, Traditional Speech Therapy Randomized Controlled Trial), a subset of 8 children will be selected who show a deficit in one domain (auditory or somatosensory) and intact perception in the other. Single-case methods will be used to test the hypothesis that sensory deficit profiles differentially predict response to visual-acoustic vs ultrasound biofeedback."

Informed, Motivated, Aware and Responsible Adolescents and Adults- South Africa (IMARA-SA) is an evidence-based HIV-prevention intervention for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and their female caregivers, which has been adapted for a South African audience. This pilot study will assess feasibility in preparation for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Additionally, the pilot will examine the preliminary effectiveness of IMARA-SA in reducing sexually transmitted infections (STI) and increasing uptake of HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at follow-up among AGYW. About 60 AGYW-FC dyads will be enrolled and randomized to IMARA-SA or a health-promotion control arm. Following randomization, the dyads will participate in an \\~2-day group workshop (\\~10 hours), which includes joint and separate mother and daughter activities. AGYW and FC will complete baseline assessments and follow-up assessments approximately 6 months later. Assessments will include surveys, STIs testing (for chlamydia and gonorrhea), and uptake of HTC and a 1-month PrEP prescription. Additionally, the intervention's implementation (e.g., acceptability) will be explored."

            "brief_description": "More US residents are dependent on marijuana than on any other illicit drug, and the number enrolled in treatment for marijuana continues to increase such that it is now comparable to that for cocaine and heroin. This application seeks to advance the overarching goal to develop and disseminate cost-effective treatments for marijuana dependence that can address this growing problem.\n\nThe researchers' previous research suggests that an intervention comprising motivational enhancement, cognitive-behavioral, and contingency-management components (MET\/CBT\/CM) produces greater rates of successful and durable outcomes than has been demonstrated previously. However, three issues relevant to its efficacy and eventual dissemination must be confronted. First, the outcomes achieved can only be characterized as modest; many individuals do not respond to the treatment and relapse rates remain problematic. Second, access is limited by the availability of trained providers. Third, the cost of delivering the treatment is higher than more traditional outpatient interventions.\n\nTo address these issues, Specific Aim 1 is to develop and test a computer-assisted version of MET\/CBT\/CM. Computerized treatments have the potential to increase overall effectiveness of treatment services by increasing availability of and access to potent treatments, and by applying innovative technology to enhance outcomes. During Year 1, the intervention will be developed and pilot tested. An interactive program that showed promise in a previous trial for opioid dependence will be modified and enhanced to deliver individualized MET\/CBT\/CM using effective computer learning technologies. These technologies and access to the MET\/CBT\/CM program made available via the Internet between treatment sessions and after treatment ends have the potential to promote better learning and more use of coping skills, which in turn can improve outcomes. During Years 2-4 a randomized trial will provide an initial efficacy test of cMET\/CBT\/CM by comparing it with a brief treatment (MET) and with therapist-delivered MET\/CBT\/CM. Specific Aim 2 is to learn more about how behavioral treatments like MET\/CBT\/CM work by focusing on two putative mechanisms of action examined in prior trials: self-efficacy\/coping skills and impulsivity\/delay discounting. The experimental design will provide a unique opportunity to explore such mechanisms in a novel context- where the therapist is vs. is not a prominent part of the treatment.\n\nThe proposed project will address the objectives of NIDA's Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development Program by providing research on technology-assisted treatment that attempts to make treatment delivery less complex, easier to access, and less costly - while retaining or improving its effectiveness. Findings will inform future studies designed to refine the technology and how it is applied; conduct more definitive effectiveness testing; test generality to other populations including adolescents; and to further advance translation to community settings."

Develop and pilot test the data collection tool with consultant and advisory panel input. Interviews of NH administrators and staff who participate in the pilot testing of CHATO and a process evaluation will be used to identify and develop supports for implementation and sustainability in preparation for future CHATO testing.\n\nDesign and Outcomes The R61 will prepare for the R01 pragmatic trial by establishing feasibility of online modules and preliminary efficacy of CHATO with NH staff. The research design is a randomized clinical trial. One NH will provide initial feasibility testing. Any modifications to the modules will be made. Then six nursing homes (estimated N=150 staff) will be randomly assigned to intervention or wait-list control groups. The primary outcome will be knowledge gain for staff completing CHATO training. Additional outcomes include resident quality measures related to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) on both resident and facility levels and facility level data related to inappropriate use of psychotropic medications to control BPSD. Implementation strategies will be assessed by survey and leadership interviews completed by an external evaluator.\n\nInterventions and Duration Changing Talk Online (CHATO) training is a course is to increase awareness of the importance of effective communication with older adults and to use evidence-based person-centered communication during interactions with older adults in nursing homes and other health care settings. The total program is approximately 3 hours, split into 3 modules. Each module is approximately an hour, depending on the individual user. Each NH will work with the research team for three months to plan, implement, and collect data.\n\nSample Size and Population This course is designed for staff in nursing homes, independent and assisted living, and health care settings in the community that include registered nurses, nursing assistants, nursing home dieticians, direct care professionals, other administrations and support employees. All the employees at all seven nursing homes will be asked to participate. Assignment of NHs to intervention and wait-list control groups will be at random. A sample of 150 training participants are estimated."

            "brief_description": "Childhood obesity is a formidable public health issue in the United States, disproportionately affecting children from lower socioeconomic status households. Onset of obesity predicts cardiometabolic risks and other health problems in adolescence and into adulthood; thus, effective and early prevention is critical. Healthy parenting may play a pivotal role in preventing early childhood obesity. Warm, responsive, and consistent parenting is associated with the development of child self-regulation as well as healthy eating and physical activity practices, and thus may be protective against obesity risk. Targeting the parent-child relationship may be especially important when facilitating behavior change in parents who have ongoing stressors (e.g., low-income families). The proposed study aims to test an adaptation of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an innovative parent management program that improves the parent-child relationship and enhances general parenting skills through the use of therapeutic in vivo coaching. Our adapted version, PCIT-Health, is a selective-prevention intervention that includes content specific to improving parent-child interactions and parenting in obesity-salient contexts, such as mealtime and child screen time. This project will elucidate novel approaches to, and novel targets of, early childhood obesity prevention and will provide data critical to test PCIT-Health in a large-scale randomized controlled trial. Parent-child dyads will be randomly assigned to PCIT-Health or a waitlist control in order to accomplish the following aims: AIM 1: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of the PCIT-Health delivery and assessment methods in low-income parents of overweight young children ages 3 to 6 years. AIM 2: To test the preliminary efficacy and estimate the effect size of PCIT-Health on changes in child BMI z-score (primary outcome) from baseline to (1) intervention completion and (2) 6-month post-intervention. AIM 3: To explore the effect of PCIT-Health on the following secondary outcomes: (1) parent-child relationship quality, (2) parent behavior management skills, (3) child self-regulation, (4) child eating behaviors, (5) child physical activity, and (6) child screen media use."

In this study, male college students will be recruited online, enrolled and randomly assigned to RealConsent or to a comparison condition. Prior to the intervention, investigators will ask questions about their intervening and sexually coercive behaviors and other theoretical and empirical factors related to the study outcomes. Investigators will survey the young men again at post-intervention, and at 6-months follow-up to determine whether young men in the RealConsent program intervened more often and engaged in less sexual violence compared to young men in the comparison condition. The main hypotheses are: (1) college men in the RealConsent program will report more instances of prosocial intervening; and (2) college men in the RealConsent program will report less sexual violence against women."

Recent research suggests that cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) may improve attention, memory and executive function in other disorders, and the investigators just completed pilot study with AUD Veterans found significantly greater improvements for those receiving CRT. The proposed study examines AUD outcomes and neurocognitive improvements when CRT is combined with a standardized alcohol treatment. The investigators hypothesize that CRT will improve neurocognition and AUD outcomes more than standardized alcohol treatment alone. Findings will determine whether CRT augmentation can benefit Veterans with AUDs."

Further improvements in community outcome for patients with these disorders will not occur simply through better control of clinical symptoms. Instead, it will be necessary to find treatments that address the key determinants of poor functional outcome. Evidence strongly suggests that basic (non-social) cognitive and social cognitive deficits are among the key determinants of functional outcome for these illnesses. The primary goal of this 2-year pilot study is to implement and validate a new remediation program for social cognition that is appropriate for veterans with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder."

These difficulties can make it harder to perform day-to-day activities. The purpose of this study is to test whether combining a type of non-invasive brain stimulation with computerized cognitive exercises is helpful in improving a specific type of memory skill in people who have mental health conditions.\n\nThe study is a randomized clinical trial, meaning that participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 'active' or 'inactive' brain stimulation. All participants will complete computerized cognitive exercises, also known as cognitive training.\n\nOverall, participants will be in the study for 6-8 weeks. The study involves 10 visits to the clinic over 2-4 weeks for cognitive training and either active or inactive brain stimulation. Participants will also complete paper-and-pencil assessments at the beginning and end of treatment, and one month after treatment ends."

Despite the clear detrimental impact of poor air quality on respiratory outcomes, regardless of smoking status, to investigators' knowledge, there are no studied environmental interventions targeting indoor air quality to improve respiratory health of smokers, thus ignoring a potential target for harm reduction. Investigators propose a randomized controlled intervention trial to test whether targeted reductions of multiple indoor pollutants (PM, SHS and NO2) in homes of smokers with COPD will improve respiratory outcomes. Investigators have chosen a potent, multimodal intervention (active air cleaners + Motivational intervention for SHS reduction) in order to maximize the opportunity to prove that there is a health benefit to active smokers with COPD from indoor air pollution reduction."

However, less than 5% of VA medical centers offer FPE. Clearly, a major challenge is to devise ways to deliver mental health treatments and services to Veterans who need them in ways that meet their needs and preferences. The proposed project will compare the use of a website to deliver FPE to that of in-person delivered FPE. The findings could have profound implications for the VA's ability to improve the reach, use, appeal, and effectiveness of FPE for Veterans with schizophrenia, by using an e-health model that facilitates family involvement."

Patient navigation is a strategy for guiding individuals through complex health systems, and the investigators hypothesize that this may be a promising approach for helping homeless-experienced people overcome their unique barriers to obtaining LCS.\n\nThe investigators will aim to recruit 300 people to participate in this research study; 100 will be randomly assigned to arm 1 (usual care) and 200 will be randomly assigned to arm 2 (patient navigation). Randomization of participants will be stratified by smoking status, housing status, clinical site, and whether they have previously discussed LCS with their primary care provider (PCP) to ensure balance between study groups on these variables. People assigned to the usual care arm will be referred back to their PCP for further management. People assigned to the patient navigation arm will be given the chance to work with a LCS navigator. The navigator will assist participants and their PCPs with all aspects of the LCS process in addition to offering brief tobacco counseling for current smokers.\n\nThe primary aim of the trial is to determine-among homeless-experienced people who are eligible for LCS-the effect of patient navigation on 1) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months post-enrollment and 2) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months with diagnostic follow-up of abnormal results within 1 month of the recommended time frame. Study outcomes will be assessed by examining participant health records.\n\nFollowing the intervention, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 40 participants and 10 BHCHP PCPs to better understand how the LCS process unfolds in the setting of homelessness, the ways in which the navigator facilitated this process, and opportunities for improving the navigation intervention for future use."

Four community mental health agencies participate in the research: two in San Francisco (urban) and two in N.M. (rural). One site in each setting serves as the mPOWR implementation site and the other serves as the control site. Service sites were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care conditions. A quasi experimental design was used; only eligible participants were enrolled in the study (e.g., exclusion criteria of moderate to severe cognitive impairment, patient services structured for provision of mPOWR implementation, etc.). The study design will employ repeated quantitative measures to assess change in outcomes within and across conditions over time. Qualitative methods in the form of focus group interviews will also be used to round out the information obtained about patient and provider expectations and experiences. Primary outcomes of interest include: Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12; physical and mental health aspects of health and well-being); Outcome Rating Scale (ORS; general well-being, personal well-being, close relationships, and work\/school\/friend relationships); Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (congruence of patient's and provider's participation in therapeutic decision making and patient's understanding of treatment and treatment options); Working Alliance Inventory (perception of therapeutic alliance); and Satisfaction Questionnaire (communication patterns between physicians and their patients)."

            "brief_description": "Veterans with schizophrenia, other serious mental illnesses (SMI), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are at elevated risk for co-occurring chronic medical conditions resulting in increased risk of disability, high health care spending, reduced quality of life and early mortality. Physical wellness is increasingly recognized as a key component of the VA's commitment to developing recovery-oriented and Veteran-centered mental health treatment. There is also growing recognition of the value of interventions that promote and improve patient self-management of chronic medical conditions. Building on the established efficacy of consumer facilitated medical illness self-management programming used in the general population and two recent adaptations for use with SMI adults in the public health sector (including the investigators' own evaluation of an intervention called Living Well), the investigators propose to complete a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of the Living Well intervention and simultaneously conduct a well specified process evaluation to optimize knowledge accrual regarding important factors that may improve future adoption, implementation and sustainability of the Living Well intervention in the VA system of care."

The proposed study will attempt to prevent the onset of high-risk drinking and PTSD in sexual assault survivors by developing and testing a web-based early intervention aimed at increasing contact with social supporters and mitigating the harm of negative social reactions; ultimately, results will contribute to advancing the field's understanding of the potential for social support to mitigate the harm of trauma."
